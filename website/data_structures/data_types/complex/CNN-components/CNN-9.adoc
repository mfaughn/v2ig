== CNN.9 - Assigning Authority - Namespace ID (IS)
:target-element: CNN.9

See section, _2A.2.14.4_, "_Assigning Authority (HD)_" for definition. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70363[_User-defined Table 0363 – Assigning Authority_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values. Assigning Authority is normally expressed as an HD data type, but has been flattened to 3 components here (_CNN.9_, _CNN.10_ and _CNN.11_) in this data type so that it may be fully expressed. Also note that if additional components are added to the HD data type in the future, adjustment will need to be made accordingly to this data type.

If component 1 is valued, either _CNN.8_ or _CNN.9_, or both _CNN.10_ and _CNN.11_, must be valued.
