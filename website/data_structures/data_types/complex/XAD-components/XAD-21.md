## XAD.21 - Preference Order (NM)

For an entity having multiple addresses, indicates which is the 'most preferred' (lowest number) to 'least preferred' (highest number).

If the preference order is unique across all usages for a given type, then it indicates the preference across all usages, (e.g., first try my home address, then my business address). Otherwise, the preference order is assumed to only apply within a specific usage.

Preference order numbers need not be sequential (i.e., four addresses with the priority orders of 10, 1, 5 and 15 are legitimate). The preference order numbers must be non-negative.
