== XAD.9 - County/Parish Code (CWE)

[datatype-definition]
A code that represents the county in which the specified address resides. file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70289[_User-defined Table 0289 - County/parish_] is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for this component. When this component is used to represent the county (or parish), component 8 <other geographic designation> should not duplicate it (i.e., the use of <other geographic designation> to represent the county is allowed only for the purpose of backward compatibility, and should be discouraged in this and future versions of HL7).

Allowable values: codes defined by government.
