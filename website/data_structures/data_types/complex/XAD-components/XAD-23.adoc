== XAD.23 - Address Identifier (EI)

[datatype-definition]
A unique identifier for the address.

This component allows an address to be uniquely identified, and enables the linking of a single address to multiple people and contexts. For example, each member of a family living at the same location would share the same address, having the same identifier. A correction to the address of one family member could be automatically propagated to other members of the family.
