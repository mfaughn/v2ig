== CNE.9 - Original Text (ST)
:target-element: CNE.9

[datatype-definition]
The text as seen and/or selected by the user who entered the data. Original text can be used in a structured user interface to capture what the user saw as a representation of the code on the data input screen, or in a situation where the user dictates or directly enters text, it is the text entered or uttered by the user. In a situation where the code is assigned sometime after the text was entered, original text is the text or phrase used as the basis for assigning the code.
