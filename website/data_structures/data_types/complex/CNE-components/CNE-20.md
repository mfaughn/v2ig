## CNE.20 - Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)

This component contains the ISO Object Identifier (OID) from which the value in _CNE.12_ is obtained. The value for this component is 2.16.840.1.113883.12.<mark>#</mark># where "<mark>#</mark>#" is to be replaced by the HL7 table number in the case of an HL7 defined or user defined table. For externally defined numbers, the OID registered in the HL7 OID registry should be used.

This component is required when _CNE.4_ is populated and neither _CNE.6_ nor _CNE.18_ is populated. In short either the _CNE.6_ or the _CNE.14_ or _CNE.17_ must be populated when _CNE.4_ is populated.
