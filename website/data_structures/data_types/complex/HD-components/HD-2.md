## HD.2 - Universal ID (ST)

The HD’s second component, &lt;universal ID> (UID), is a string formatted according to the scheme defined by the third component, &lt;universal ID type> (UID type). The UID is intended to be unique over time within the UID type. It is rigorously defined. Each UID must belong to one of the specifically enumerated schemes for constructing UIDs (defined by the UID type). The UID (second component) must follow the syntactic rules of the particular universal identifier scheme (defined by the third component).

These syntactic rules are not defined within HL7 but are defined by the rules of the particular universal identifier scheme (defined by the third component).
