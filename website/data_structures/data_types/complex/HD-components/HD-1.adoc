== HD.1 - Namespace ID (IS)

[datatype-definition]
The local coded item for the entity. The component intentionally remains associated with the IS data type in v 2.7.

file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID_] is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for this component.

[NOTE]
When the HD is used in a given segment (either as a field or as a component of another data type) this table may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.
