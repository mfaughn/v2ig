== FN.4 - Surname Prefix from Partner/Spouse (ST)

[datatype-definition]
Internationalization usage for Germanic languages. This component is optional. An example of a <surname prefix> is the “van” in "Ludwig van Beethoven". Since the <surname prefix> doesn't sort completely alphabetically, it is reasonable to specify it as a separate sub-component of the PN and extended PN data types (XPN and XCN).

[NOTE]
Subcomponents <own surname prefix>, <own surname>, <surname prefix from partner/spouse> and <surname from partner/spouse> decompose complex Germanic names such as “Martha de Mum-van Beethoven”. If these subcomponents are valued, the <surname> subcomponent should still be fully valued for backward compatibility, i.e., ^de Mum-van Beethoven&de&Mum&van&Beethoven^.” +
Also, for clarity, the <last name prefix> has been renamed to <own surname prefix>.
