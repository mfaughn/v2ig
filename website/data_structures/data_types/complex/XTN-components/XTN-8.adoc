== XTN.8 - Extension (SNM)

[datatype-definition]
The numeric code to contact the called party used within an organization, e.g., the number used if both caller and called party are located within the same organization. The extension is often the same as the last few digits of the Local Number. The use of extensions is country and site specific, and may depend on the type of phone system (PBX) used by the organization.
