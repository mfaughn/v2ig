== XTN.17 - Shared Telecommunication Identifier (EI)
:target-element: XTN.17

[datatype-definition]
A unique identifier for the phone number or e-mail address.

This component allows a phone number to be uniquely identified, and enables the linking of a single phone number to multiple people and contexts. For example, each member of a family living at the same location would share the same phone number, having the same identifier. A correction to the phone number of one family member could be automatically propagated to other members of the family.

HL7 does not assume responsibility for the processing rules for this component.
