[example]
1: A Work fax number

^WPN^FX^^^734^6777777

[example]
2: Telephone number with extension

^WPN^PH^^^734^6777777^1

[example]
2: Telephone number with internal code. In this example, assume that a corporation's telephone system supports a full external telephone number (area code and telephone number). It also supports internal dialing standards that assign a code to each facility and an extension to each telephone (which happens to be the last 4 digits of the external telephone number, by convention).

.So, if the Los Angeles facility were assigned code 333, and if the "outside" telephone number at the LA office is (626) 555-1234, the components would be:
[width="100%",cols="42%,58%",options="header",]
|===
|Component |Value
|area/city code |626
|phone number |555-1234
|extension |1234
|extension prefix |333
|===

The field would be transmitted as follows:

[er7]
^WPN^PH^^^626^5551234^1234^333

.Example 3: speed dial. In this example, assume that a corporation's telephone system supports speed dialing numbers. For example, suppose that a corporation has a contract with a travel agency, whose external number is 1-610-555-1234. Since it is so frequently dialed, the company assigns a speed code: #6098. The components would be:
[width="100%",cols="42%,58%",options="header",]
|===
|Component |Value
|Area/city code |610
|Phone number |555-1234
|Speed Dial |#6098
|===

The field would be transmitted as follows:

[er7]
^WPN^PH^^^610^5551234^^^#6098

.Example 4: home e-mail address. In this example, assume that a person has a primary home e-mail address such as someone@somewhere.com. The components would be:
[width="100%",cols="56%,44%",options="header",]
|===
|Component |Value
|Telecommunication Use Code |PRN
|Telecommunication Equipment Type |Internet
|Communication Address |someone@somewhere.com
|===

The field would be transmitted as follows:

[er7]
^PRN^Internet^someone@somewhere.com

.Example 5: work e-mail address. In this example, assume that a person has a work e-mail address such as someone@somewhere.com. The components would be:
[width="100%",cols="54%,46%",options="header",]
|===
|Component |Value
|Telecommunication Use Code |WPN
|Telecommunication Equipment Type |Internet
|Communication Address |someone@somewhere.com
|===

The field would be transmitted as follows:

[er7]
^WPN^Internet^someone@somewhere.com
