## PPN.14 - Assigning Facility (HD)

The place or location identifier where the identifier was first assigned to the patient. This component is not an inherent part of the identifier but rather part of the history of the identifier: as part of this data type, its existence is a convenience for certain intercommunicating systems.

When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 - Namesp__ace I__D_] (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.
