== CD.2 - Waveform Source (WVS)
:target-element: CD.2

[datatype-definition]
This component identifies the source of the waveform connected to the channel. Two names may be specified if it is necessary to individually identify the two inputs for a waveform. Only one name need be specified if the channel is connected to a single input. For example, in EKG recordings typically only one name is used (such as I or II); in electroencephalography, two names are typically used, one for each input of the differential amplifier (such as F3 and C3).
