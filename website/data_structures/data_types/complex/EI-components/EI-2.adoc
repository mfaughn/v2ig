== EI.2 - Namespace ID (IS)
:target-element: EI.2

[datatype-definition]
See Section _2A.2.33.1_, "_Namespace ID (IS)_" for definition. The component intentionally remains associated with the IS data type in v 2.7.

The assigning authority is a unique identifier of the system (or organization or agency or department) that creates the data. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70363[_User-defined Table 0__363 – Assigning Authority_] for suggested values.

[NOTE]
When the HD is used as a part of another data type, in this case as part of the EI data type, this table may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.

By site agreement, implementers may continue to use file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[User-defined Table 0300 – Namespace ID] for the first component
