== XCN.2 - Family Name (FN)

[datatype-definition]
This component allows full specification of the surname of a person. Where appropriate, it differentiates the person's own surname from that of the person's partner or spouse, in cases where the person's name may contain elements from either name. It also permits messages to distinguish the surname prefix (such as "van" or "de") from the surname root. See section _2A.2.30_, "_FN - family name_".

_XCN.2_ is required if _XCN.1_ is not populated. Both may be populated.
