== PL.11 - Assigning Authority for Location (HD)
:target-element: PL.11

[datatype-definition]
The entity that creates the data for the individual physical location components. If populated, it should be the authority for all components populated. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70363[_User-defined Table 0363 – Assigning Authority_] for suggested values for the first sub-component of the HD component, <namespace ID>.

This component makes it possible for codes to be differentiated when the field in which this data type is used repeats.

[NOTE]
When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID_] (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.

By site agreement, implementors may continue to use file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 – Namespace ID_] for the first sub-component.
