## PL.4 - Facility (HD)

This component is subject to site interpretation but generally describes the highest level physical designation of an institution, medical center or enterprise. It is the most general person location designation.

See Section _2A.2.33_, “_HD - hierarchic designator_” for discussion of data type.

When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 - Na__mespace ID_] (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be redefined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.
