A code structure to relate amounts or values to identified data elements necessary to process this claim as qualified by the payer organization.

This data type is used to convey information defined by CMS or other regulatory agencies. It corresponds to UB fields 46A, 47A, 48A, 49A, 46B, 47B, 48B, and 49B and UB92 fields 39a, 39b, 39c, 39d, 40a, 40b, 40c, 40d, 41a, 41b, 41c, and 41d.

[NOTE]
Replaces the CM data type used in sections 6.5.10.10 UB1-10 and 6.5.11.6 UB2-6, as of v 2.5.

The most common semi-private room rate is used in instances where the patient is placed in a private room at their request but their insurance only covers a semi-private room rate, which can be calculated using the 01-most common semi-private room rate.
