## RFR.3 - Age Range (NR)

This component specifies the age range for which the reference range is valid. Ages of less than one year should be specified as a fraction (e.g., 1 month = 0.0830, 1 week = 0.01920, 1 day = 0.0027300). However, for most purposes involving infants, the gestational age (measured in weeks) is preferred. The lower end of the range is not indicated; the upper end is, assuring that series of ranges do not overlap.
