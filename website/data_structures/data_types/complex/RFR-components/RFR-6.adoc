== RFR.6 - Race/subspecies (ST)

[datatype-definition]
This component specifies the race or subspecies for which the reference range is valid. In the case of humans (the default species), the race is specified when race influences the reference range. When normal ranges for animals are being described, this component can be used to describe subspecies or special breeds of animals.
