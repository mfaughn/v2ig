The value for this component for an HL7 or User Defined table SHALL be the value published for the code system OID for the table in _Chapter 2C Code Tables_. For externally defined code systems the OID registered in the HL7 OID registry SHALL be used.

This component is required when _CWE.1_ is populated and _CWE.3_ is not populated. Both _CWE.3_ and _CWE.14_ may be populated.

[NOTE]
