== CP.5 - Range Units (CWE)
:target-element: CP.5

[datatype-definition]
This component describes the units associated with the range, e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, days, quantity (i.e., count). As of v2.7 the Externally-defined Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) case sensitive code is the required code for units of measure. Refer to the externally-defined table "Unified Code for Units of Measure" (UCUM) [http://aurora.rg.iupui.edu/UCUM] for valid values. Local codes may be transmitted in addition to UCUM codes.

This component is required if _CP.3 From Value_ and/or _CP.4 To Value_ are present.
