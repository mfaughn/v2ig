## CP.3 - From Value (NM)

The number specifying the lower limit or boundary of the range. This component, together with the _CP.4_ component, specifies the "price range". The range can be defined as either time or quantity. For example, the range can indicate that the first 10 minutes of the procedure has one price. Another repetition of the data type can use the range to specify that the following 10 to 60 minutes of the procedure is charged at another price per; a final repetition can specify that the final 60 to N minutes of the procedure at a third price.

If the _CP.2 Price Type_ component is TP, both _CP.3_ and _CP.4_ may be null.
