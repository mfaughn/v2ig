|A41 - Merge account information - patient account number |
|Use Case - Eve Everywoman (patient identifier MR1) is a recurring outpatient at the Physical Therapy clinic at hospital XYZ with account number ACCT1. She has visited the clinic several times. When she arrives for therapy, a new registrar does not realize she already has an account and opens a new one with account number ACCT2. When the mistake is discovered, the two accounts are merged together, combining all visits under account ACCT1. |
|Target: _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ |
|Source: _MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_ |

Implementation considerations: This scenario exists when two accounts are established for the same patient.

The PV1 segment is not valued since this event is really a merge at the _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ level. All identifiers below the _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ are combined under the surviving Patient Account Number.

Since there could be a discrepancy in the demographic information between the two records, reconciliation may be required. Surviving and non-surviving demographic information is application and implementation specific. An A08 (update patient information) event should be sent and/or negotiated as necessary to provide for implementation and application-specific needs.
