===== Superior identifier reporting
[v291_section="3.6.2.1.11"]

When merging or moving subordinate numbers, the higher level, "superior" identifiers should be included in the message. For example, when merging an account where the target is _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ and the source is _MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_, the higher level patient identifiers (_PID-3 -Patient Identifier List_ and _MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_) and person identifiers (_PID-2 - Patient ID_ and _MRG-4 - Prior Patient ID_) should also be reported in the message.
