===== Change identifier
[v291_section="3.6.2.1.4"]

A change identifier event signals that a single person, patient, account, or visit identifier has been changed. It does not reflect a merge or a move; it is simply a change of an identifier. For example, a "Change Identifier" event would be sent to signal that the registrar has changed an incorrectly assigned person identifier to a correct person identifier. The following picture graphically depicts this event:
