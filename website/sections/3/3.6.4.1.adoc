==== Definitions - what is an MPI?
[v291_section="3.6.4.1"]

There can be quite a bit of confusion as to what defines an MPI. Early definitions called it a Master Patient Index, implying only patient data would be managed. Later the definition was expanded to mean persons in general, including patients, guarantors, subscribers, and even providers; essentially any entity that could be considered a "person." Thus the current acronym MPI generally is inferred to mean Master Person Index.

An MPI is generally used to manage person identification and cross-reference across disparate systems. Healthcare organizations may have several systems handling various different data processing needs, from laboratory to billing, each with its own database of persons and person identifier numbering schemes. Each of these can be called an ID Domain. An MPI can function as a Correlation Manager between these domains, providing a cross-reference of a person's identifiers across each of the domains. Typically an MPI will also have one universal or enterprise identifier that uniquely identifies the person in the MPI itself. The domain for this identifier may or may not be the domain for clients of the MPI.

MPI functionality also typically includes methods to provide an identifier for a person, given a set of traits or demographics for that person. An example of the use of this is for a client system to query the MPI for a person given a set of demographics. The MPI uses matching algorithms to find possible matching persons, and returns to the client system the identifiers for those persons.

This section currently deals only with MPI functionality related to persons in the context of Version 2.4 and later. It is assuming integration using Version 2.4 and later ADT messages, and the functionality surrounding finding and identifying a person.
