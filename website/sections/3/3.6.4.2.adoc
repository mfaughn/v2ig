==== HL7 and CORBAmed PIDS
[v291_section="3.6.4.2"]

There has been an effort to harmonize the modeling work that has been done in the CORBAMed Patient Identification Service (PIDS) with the HL7 message set, with an eye toward HL7 Version 3.0. You may see evidence of CORBAMed modeling in this implementation, but that should not be taken as evidence that full harmonization has taken place. There is much work left to do in this area.
