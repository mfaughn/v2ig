=== Query for Order Information – Triggers for Download of Test Orders
[v291_section="13.4.4"]

There is no specific query for laboratory order information. Instead, the order information should be downloaded to the LAS either unsolicited (based on LIS internal triggers such as Sample Collected or Order Entered) or after an implicit trigger such as Sample Status Update – sample identified by the LAS.
