==== Accession Identifier (also accession number):
[v291_section="13.1.1.1"]

A numeric (or alphanumeric) identifier assigned by the LIS for a test order. Depending on the particular LIS a patient's test orders for a single encounter may use one or more accession identifiers and each accession identifier may encompass one or more tests and one or more specimens and/or specimen containers. However, accession identifiers are unique within each patient encounter. The Accession identifier may not be equal to the Placer or Filler Order Numbers, because of uniqueness requirement.
