== Trigger Events and Message Definitions
[v291_section="13.2"]

Each trigger event is listed below, along with the application form of the message exchange. The notation used to describe the sequence, optionality and repetition of segments is described in Chapter 2.

The notation used to describe the sequence, the optionality, and the repetition of segments is described in Chapter 2 under "Format for Defining Abstract Message."

All the ACK messages are varieties of the 'general acknowledgement' message defined in Chapter 2, section 2.13.1. The only difference is the event code.

The "Equipment Notification" message (EAN/ACK event U09) is used to send information about the occurrence of an event. An event does not necessarily cause a state transition. The "Status Update" message (EAU/ACK event U01) is used to transfer information about the current status. This status can be the result of one or more events that led to the state transition. Example: The event of a "warning level of a consumable being reached" (e.g., 10% left) does not cause a state transition, because the system can remain "In operation". This results in an EAN/ACK message. An event "container transport jammed" causes the state transition to "Emergency stop". This results in both EAN/ACK and EAU/ACK messages.

For the transfer of laboratory automation orders and results refer to 4.4.6 OML - laboratory order message (event O21) instead of ORM and 7.3.2 OUL – unsolicited laboratory observation message (event O20) instead of ORU.
