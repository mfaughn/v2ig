A pre-analytical instrument 0001 performed aliquoting and sorting operation. +
(See Fig. 13-5 for visualization of positions and locations) +
The carrier (id=2002) with primary/parent container (id=12345) at position 2 was transported in the location: output buffer 1, into position 4 of the output tray (id=A1203). +
The aliquot container (id=12345A) was sorted into the manual transportable carrier (id=045), in row 3, column 2. This carrier is located in the sorter bed at location 4.
