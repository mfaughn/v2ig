==== Rule 1
[v291_section="12.2.5.1"]

The trigger event defines the action at the first level of the hierarchy, and should not be contradicted by either hierarchical linkages or segment action codes. Thus, a PC1 (problem add) event should only contain problem, goal, and role segments that have action codes *ADD*.
