=== Controlled Disclosure, Notification of Disclosed Information as Protected and Tracking Exceptions of Protected Health Information
[v291_section="1.8.10"]

HL7 Version 2.x standards are silent on supporting the controlled disclosure of protected health information where HL7 is the vehicle of the disclosure across multiple systems in a healthcare delivery system. It is also silent on messages that notify a user that requested information is protected and messages to track allowed exceptions that may take place at the discretion of potentially, but not certified, authorized users (e.g., a physician in the emergency room). For links to related HL7 Version 2 segments see 1.8.2.
