=== Uniform Data Definition and Data Architecture
[v291_section="1.8.9"]

HL7 Version 2.x standards do not include an explicit data model or composite data dictionary. However, extensive work has taken place within the HL7 Working Group to produce a data model for previous versions of HL7 2.x. While these models have not been formally balloted, they are available on the HL7 web server.
