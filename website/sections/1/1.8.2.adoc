=== Protection of Healthcare Information
[v291_section="1.8.2"]

HL7 Version 2.9.1 is largely silent about the issues of privacy authentication and confidentiality of data that pass through HL7 messages. HL7 makes no assumption about the ultimate use of data but rather assumes that both source and destination applications provide for these requirements. In addition, HL7 does not, at this time, specify what, if any, encryption method should be used when transporting HL7-based messages between two or more systems. At this time, HL7 implementers should familiarize themselves with legal and professional requirements for these topics specific to their country’s national or local requirements.

However HL7 provides a standardized way of exchanging requirements for restrictions as well as identifying the data affected by privacy law and confidentiality rules. HL7 has developed the HL7 Healthcare Privacy and Security Classification System (HCS), Release 1 (see: http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=345).

In v2.9.1 this vocabulary can be used in the following segments:

• Message Header segment (MSH) in chapter 2.14.9

• User Access Control segment (UAC) in chapter 2.4.15

• Access Restriction segment (ARV) in chapter 3.3.14

• Consent segment (CON) in chapter 9.7.1

Implementers are encourqaged to make use of these fields in their respective implementation guides.
