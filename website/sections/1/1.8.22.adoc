=== Infrastructure Based Applications
[v291_section="1.8.22"]

A number of applications and information delivery methods exist within the healthcare delivery environment that can be closely identified with the “infrastructure” that ties together disparate systems. These applications include, but are not limited to:

Robust and Integrated Scheduling +
Point of Service Support +
Prompts Alerts and Reminders +
Concurrent Data Surveillance, Metrics and Analysis +
Concurrent Decision Support +
Outcome Tracking +
Tracking of Patient (i.e., customer) Expectation and Satisfaction +
Problem Lists

These, and probably others, could be well served by the use of healthcare data during and very close to the action of transferring information between healthcare information systems. HL7 Version 2, at this time, has very little or no message functionality that directly supports these uses of healthcare data.
