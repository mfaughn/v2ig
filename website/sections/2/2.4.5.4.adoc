==== Type and Component/Field lengths
[v291_section="2.4.5.4"]

Either normative or conformative lengths MAY be specified on a primitive data type. Whether or not normative or conformance lengths are specified on the data type, they MAY also be specified on the components and/or fields where the data type is used. If specified here, they override the length specified for the type (but must be consistent with the information on the type). If not specified, then the information specified on the data type itself – if present – applies where the data type is used.

Minimum and maximum lengths are not assigned for composite data types (data types having more than one component). Not only can the minimum or maximum lengths be indeterminate, it is misleading to report a length with separator characters included, and also misleading to associate a length with a composite component that must be broken up when it is stored. For these reasons derived lengths are not reported in this standard, though implementers MAY derive them as desired.
