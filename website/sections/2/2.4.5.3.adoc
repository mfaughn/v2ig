==== Conformance Length
[v291_section="2.4.5.3"]

If populated, the conformance length column specifies the minimum length that applications must be able to store. Conformant applications SHALL NOT truncate a value that is shorter than the length specified. The conformance length is also the minimum value that SHOULD be assigned to maximum length in an implementation profile.

In addition, the conformance length MAY be followed by a “=” or a “#”. The “=” denotes the value MAY never be truncated, and the “#” denotes that the truncation behaviour defined for the data type applies.

Applications are not required to implement the truncation pattern, even if it can be applied to an item. Applications SHOULD declare their adoption of the truncation pattern in their conformance profiles.
