=== HL7 batch protocol
[v291_section="2.9.3"]

There are instances when it is convenient to transfer a batch of HL7 messages. Common examples would be a batch of financial posting detail transactions (DFT's) sent from an ancillary to a financial system. Such a batch could be sent online using a common file transfer protocol, or offline via tape or diskette.
