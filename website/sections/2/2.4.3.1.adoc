==== Field or Component Status
[v291_section="2.4.3.1"]

HL7 does not care how systems actually store data within an application. When fields are transmitted, they are sent as character strings

A field SHALL exist in one of three population states in an HL7 message:

*Populated*. (Synonyms: valued, non-blank, not blank, not empty.) The sending system sends a value in the field. For example, if a sending system includes medical record number, that would be communicated as |1234567^^^MR^KP-CA|.

[NOTE]
that the field might be populated with a code that means "no information" or "unknown".

*Not populated*. (Synonyms: unpopulated, not valued, unvalued, blank, empty, not present, missing.) The sending system does not supply a value for the field. The Sender might or might not have a value for the field. The receiving system can make no inference regarding the absence of an element value if there is not a conformance profile governing the implementation. However, if there is a Conformance Message Profile in effect, then special rules apply; see section 2.B, "Conformance Using Message Profiles".

*Null. HL7 v2.x does not have an explicit concept for null values.*

*Populated with Delete Indicator:* Any existing value for the corresponding data base element in the receiving application SHOULD be deleted. This is symbolically communicated as two double-quotes between the delimiters (i.e., |""|).Employing consecutive double quote characters as the only content of a field for other purposes is prohibited.

Refer to Chapter link:#_Message_construction_rules[_2.5_], "link:#_Message_construction_rules[_Message construction rules_]" for information on data fields with a delete indicator.

The various chapters of the Standard contain segment attribute tables. These tables list and describe the data fields in the segment and characteristics of their usage. In defining a segment, the following information is specified about each field:

{empty}1. SEQ : Position

{empty}2. LEN : Normative Length

{empty}3. C.LEN : Conformance Length

{empty}4. DT : Data Type

{empty}5. OPT: Optionality

{empty}6. RP/# : Repitition

{empty}7. TBL# : Table Identifier

{empty}8. ITEM# : ID Number

{empty}9. Element Name

Chapter 2A contains similar tables that describe the components of a data type. In defining a data type, the following information is specified about each component:

{empty}1. SEQ : Position

{empty}2. LEN : Normative Length

{empty}3. C.LEN : Conformance Length

{empty}4. DT : Data Type

{empty}5. OPT: Optionality

{empty}6. TBL# : Table Identifier

{empty}7. Component Name

{empty}8. Comments

{empty}9. SEC.REF: The reference to where the data type is defined

The following sections describe the information that is provided in the table.
