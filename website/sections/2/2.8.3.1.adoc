==== Transmit general acknowledgment message
[v291_section="2.8.3.1"]

A general acknowledgment message is not always required by the initiating system, but if it is the responding system sends one of the following:

{empty}a) a commit accept (CA) in link:#_MSA-1___Acknowledgment Code  (ID)  [MSA-1 Acknowledgment Code] if the message can be accepted for processing

{empty}b) a commit reject (CR) in link:#_MSA-1___Acknowledgment Code  (ID)  [MSA-1 Acknowledgment Code] if the one of the values of link:#_MSH-9___Message Type  (MSG)   00009[MSH-9 Message Type], link:#msh-12-version-id-vid-00012[MSH-12 Version ID] or link:#_MSH-11___Processing ID  (PT)   0001[MSH-11 Processing ID] is not acceptable to the receiving application

{empty}c) a commit error (CE) in link:#_MSA-1___Acknowledgment Code  (ID)  [MSA-1 Acknowledgment Code] if the message cannot be accepted for any other reason (e.g., sequence number error)

[NOTE]
If the Acknowledgment Code is other than CA, the reason(s) for the rejection SHOULD be sent in the ERR segment(s) to notify the sender of the exact problem.*

The MSH segment in the response is constructed anew following the rules used to create the initial message described above. In particular, link:#_MSH-7___Date/Time Of Message  (DTM)[MSH-7 Date/Time of Message] and link:#_MSH-10___Message Control ID  (ST)  [MSH-10 Message Control ID] refer to the response message; they are not echoes of the fields in the initial message. link:#_MSH-5___Receiving Application  (HD)[MSH-5 Receiving Application], link:#_MSH-6___Receiving Facility  (HD)   [MSH-6 Receiving Facility], and link:#_MSH-11___Processing ID  (PT)   0001[MSH-11 Processing ID] contain codes that are copied from link:#_MSH-3___Sending Application  (HD)  [MSH-3 Sending Application], link:#_MSH-4___Sending Facility  (HD)   00[MSH-4 Sending Facility] and link:#_MSH-11___Processing ID  (PT)   0001[MSH-11 Processing ID] in the initiating message.

.For this response, the following values are put in the MSA segment. Note that the field definitions for the MSA segment fields are in Section _2.13.8_, '_MSA ‑ Message Acknowledgment segment_":
[width="100%",cols="35%,65%",]
