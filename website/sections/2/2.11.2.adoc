=== HL7 Acknowledgment Choreography Example
[v291_section="2.11.2"]

Using the example messages in Figure 2-5. Hypothetical schematic message for the WRQ/WRP message pair:

o When MSH-15 is blank and MSH-16 is blank an original mode acknowledgment SHALL be returned on the same communication channel.

o When MSH-15 is AL (Always) and MSH-16 is NE (Never) an immediate ack is always returned. When MSH-15 is NE, and MSH-16 is AL, the receiver is expected to only return an WRP application acknowledgment on a separate communication channel. See Section 2.8.3.2

.o When MSH-15 is AL, and MSH-16 is AL, the receiver is expected to return both the immediate ACK as well as the WRP application ack. The immediate ACK will return on the current channel, and the application acknowledgment on a separate communication channel. See Section 2.8.3.2
