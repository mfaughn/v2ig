==== Normative Length
[v291_section="2.4.5.0"]

For some fields or components, the value domain of the content leads to clearly established boundaries for minimum and/or maximum length of the content. In these cases, these known limits are specified for the item. Normative lengths are only specified for primitive data types.

[example]
s of value domains that have clearly established boundaries for minimum and maximum length:

• A date/time field: See 2.A.22 DTM date/time for detailed examples.

o 4..4 for year

o 4..6 for Year to month

o 8..8 for year to day

• A component whose values are limited to a set of fixed length strings, e.g.(ABC, SYL, or IDE)A component that contains a reference to a field in a message

The information is given in one of two forms:

• The minimum and the maximum length separated by two dots, e.g. m..n

• the list of possible values for length separated by commas, e.g. x,y,z

When a normative length is asserted and assertion is a range, conformant messages SHALL have a length that lies within the boundaries specified. The boundaries are inclusive, so a length of 1..2 means the length of the item SHALL be either 1 or 2. When a normative length is asserted and assertion is a list of values, conformant messages SHALL have a length that is one of the values in the list.

[NOTE]
The minimum length is always 1 or more. If an item is optional, and there is no content present, the item is considered as not populated, rather than present with a length of 0.

[NOTE]
The deletion indicator is treated as having no length and therefore fits to all length specifications.
