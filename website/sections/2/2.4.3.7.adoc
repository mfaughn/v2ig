==== Repetition
[v291_section="2.4.3.7"]

[datatype-definition]
Whether the field MAY repeat. The value that appears in the repetitions column is the maximum number of allowed occurrences, e.g., a value of '3' would mean that the field can have '3 occurrences'; if unspecified, there is only one occurrence, i.e., cannot repeat.

In the segment attribute tables this information is provided in the column labeled *RP/#.* Note that components and subcomponents MAY NOT repeat, so this does not apply to components and subcomponents.

.The designations for Repetition are:
[width="100%",cols="14%,4%,82%",]
|===
|N or blank |- |no repetition
|Y |- |the field MAY repeat an indefinite or site-determined number of times
|(integer) |- |the field MAY repeat up to the number of times specified by the integer
|===

Each occurrence MAY contain the number of characters specified by the field's maximum length. See Section _2_.

Usage Note: For improved readability some work groups opt to leave the Repetition fields blank to indicate that the field SHALL NOT repeat. A blank SHALL NOT be construed to mean that the field MAY optionally repeat.

As of v2.5 the Repetition column is to be left blank if the field SHALL NOT repeat.
