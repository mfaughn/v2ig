=== Protocol for interpreting repeating fields in an update message
[v291_section="2.9.5"]

With repeating fields, the segment action codes are not relevant. Action codes cannot be applied to individual field repetitions, because they cannot be uniquely identified. Therefore, they must all be there, i.e., send a full list for each transaction. If the intent is to delete an element, it is left off the list. This is analogous to the snapshot mode for repeating segments and segment groups. If the intent is to delete the whole list, the field is transmitted once with a delete indicator in the first component. In effect, the Sender must make a statement about what action the receiver is expected to take: omitting, or not populating, the field is not a clear signal according to field state definition as described in section 2.5.3.

At the same time, it is not incorrect to be precise about specific information that is to be deleted if the data type supports this capability. Note, however, that data types without components, e.g., ID or ST do not support this capability. There is no way to tie the delete indicator to an actual element instance in the persistent data store. See the example below.

Special consideration is warranted when implementing multiple interfaces. While the same processing rules (snapshot or update) can be applied to multiple systems and interfaces, desynchronization can occur if any one system is receiving similar information from multiple sources. Business rules and processes need to be considered in these cases to determine if there is a single authoritative source for the information (a "System of Record"), or if other business logic exists to resolve the possibility that information from the two (or more) sources are not in agreement.

[example]
Repeating field of data type ID: A patient is added to the Master Patient Index. The patient has two specific living conditions: "spouse dependent" and "medical supervision required". This is transmitted as:

MSH|^~\&||||||||ADT^A28^ADT_A05|1|P|2.7...<cr>

EVN|...<cr>

[er7]
PID|||1234567^^^^MRN| <cr>

PV1|...<cr>

[er7]
PD1|S~M|

Subsequently, the "medical supervision required" living condition is dropped.

[er7]
MSH|^~\&||||||||ADT^A31^ADT_A31|1|P|2.7...<cr>

EVN|...<cr>

[er7]
PID|||1234567^^^^MRN|<cr>

PV1|...<cr>

[er7]
PD1|S||||||||||||||||||||||

The data type for PD1-1 is a data types without components. There is no way to tie the delete indicator to an actual element instance in the persistent data store. Therefore the following is ambiguous and not good practice.

[er7]
MSH|^~\&||||||||ADT^A31^ADT_A31|1|P|2.7...<cr>

EVN|...<cr>
