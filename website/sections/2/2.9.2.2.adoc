==== Segment fragmentation across messages
[v291_section="2.9.2.2"]

If the last segment of a fragment itself needs to be broken, then the following idiomatic use of ADD SHALL apply.

{empty}a) the segment being continued (call it ANY for this example) is ended at an arbitrary character position and terminated with the standard segment terminator (carriage return).

{empty}b) the following segment is the ADD segment. It will contain no characters other than "ADD". (The lack of characters signals the receiver that ANY will be continued.)

{empty}c) The second following segment will be the DSC, used as described above in Section _2.9.2.1_, "_Segment fragmentation/continuation using the DSC segment_".

{empty}d) The first segment of the following fragment will be an ADD segment. The characters of this ADD segment are logically part of the ANY segment of the previous fragment.

For example

[er7]
MSH|...|2.4|

ANY|12

ADD

DSC|JR97

--------- (fragment 2)

[er7]
MSH|...|2.4|JR97

ADD|345

is logically the same as

[er7]
MSH|...|2.4

ANY|12345

{empty}e) transaction flow for a continued unsolicited message with a continued segment.

.First unsolicited message and acknowledgment:
[width="100%",cols="29%,71%",]
|===
|MSH |
|URD |
|[ URS ] |
|\{DSP} |(last DSP is incomplete)
|ADD |(contains no fields)
|DSC |(Continuation segment)
|===

[width="100%",cols="29%,71%",]
|===
|MSH |(General acknowledgment)
|MSA |
|[ \{ ERR } ] |
|===

.Second unsolicited message and acknowledgment:
[width="100%",cols="29%,71%",]
|===
|MSH |(contains continuation pointer from DSC segment of prior message)
|ADD |(contains remainder of data from continued DSP segment from prior message)
|\{DSP} |
|===

.*Note*: This second message could itself be continued with a second DSC and (if needed) a second ADD segment prior to it.
[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",]
