=== Snapshot Mode
[v291_section="7.2.1"]

Chapter 2, Section 2.10.4 defines the meaning of snapshot mode updates and indicates that each chapter or related implementation guides may further refine this definition. The following guidance applies to results messages:

• In some instances there are tests that have a precise relationship between the parent and child to assist the clinician in understanding to which OBX in the parent OBR the child is connected. In those instances the ORDER_OBSERVATION segment groups of the parent and other children should be included in the snapshot rather than sending the child's ORDER_OBSERVATION segment group (including the OBR/OBX set) by itself. Example: OBRs of the parent OBR (example would be microbiology with culture and Sensitivity Panels (Sensi-Panels)), unless advised otherwise by trading partners, would be included in the snapshot reporting.
