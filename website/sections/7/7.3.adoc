[v291_section="7.3"]

The triggering events that follow are all served by the ORU (Unsolicited Observation Message, Unsolicited Point-of-Care Observation Message, Unsolicited Alert Observation Message), the OUL (Observational Report – Automated Lab), or the OPU (Observational Report - Population) messages in combination with ACK and ORA (Observational Report - Application Acknowledgement). Each triggering event is listed below, along with the messages exchanged, and the segments that comprise the messages. The notation used to describe the sequence, optionality, and repeating of segments is described in Chapter 2, "Format for defining abstract messages."
