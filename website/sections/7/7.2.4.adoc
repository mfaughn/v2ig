=== Narrative Reports as Batteries with Many OBX
[v291_section="7.2.4"]

Narrative reports from services such as Radiology usually consist of a number of subcomponents (e.g., a chest X-ray report may consist of a description, an impression, and a recommendation). Other studies, such as echocardiograms, contain analogous components, as well as numeric observations (e.g., left ventricular and diastolic diameter). Surgical pathology reports may contain information about multiple specimens and reports: the anatomic source, the gross description, the microscopic description, and a diagnostic impression for each specimen.

The current Standard treats each component of a narrative report as a separate "test" or observation. Just as a CHEM12 is transmitted as an order segment (OBR) plus 12 OBX segments, a chest X-ray would be transmitted as an order (OBR) segment plus three OBX segments, one for the description, one for the impression, and one for the recommendations. Similarly, an EKG report would be transmitted as an order segment (OBR), two OBX segments for the impression and recommendation, and additional OBX segments for each EKG measurement, e.g., the PR interval, QR interval, QRS axis, and so on.
