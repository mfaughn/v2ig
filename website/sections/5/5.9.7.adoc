Query by example (QBP) / tabular response (RTB)

This section demonstrates how to use a different syntax for passing query parameters to the query server. This syntactic variant is called "query by example" because, instead of passing query parameter as fields of the QBP segment, they are passed as fields of existing HL7 segments. Nevertheless, the Query Profile will clearly specify which fields of the HL7 segment can carry useful values. Note that both the QBP syntax and the "query by example" syntax have the same expressive power. Also note that when segments are used in the "query by example" variant, the required/optional characteristics of each field should be defined in the Query Profile, and that field optionality in queries may be different from the usual optionality of the segment when used in other HL7 messages.

This sample shows how the "query by example" might be used to find a list of candidates matching a set of demographics. Because demographic data is naturally carried by the existing PID segment, the message designer may, for stylistic or practical reasons, decide to pass the demographic parameters such as patient name or patient age in a PID segment.

The Client wishes to see a list of patients whose demographics are as follows:

Last Name: Nuclear +
First Name: Ned +
Sex: Male +
DOB: 12/11/48

The Client wishes to do this using the peekaboo algorithm with an 80% confidence level.
