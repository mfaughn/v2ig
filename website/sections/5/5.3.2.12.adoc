*ColName*: The name used to identify the column, or field, in the complex expression.

*Comp. Name*: When the *ColName* is of a composite data type (e.g., XPN), this is the name of an individual component of the column. Only those components that may be valued should be listed.

When specifying a field in the complex expression, both the *ColName* and *Comp. Name* attributes should be sent if only a single component is being identified. For instance, *PatientList.ID* would specify the ID component of the *PatientList* field.

*DT*: The data type of the field or component.

*Description*: A narrative description of the field or component and how it is to be used.
