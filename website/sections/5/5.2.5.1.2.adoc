===== Expression as query by example
[v291_section="5.2.5.1.2"]

Just as in the Simple Parameter variant, the Query by Example requires an exact parameter specification. The distinction in a Query by Example is that segments other than QPD are used to transmit the parameters. The segments offered should be already-existing segments that the Server can parse easily.

The client system transmits a Query by Example in the following format.
