== INTRODUCTION
[v291_section="5.2"]

This chapter defines the rules that apply to queries and to their responses. It also defines the unsolicited display messages because their message syntax is query-like in nature.

.Version 2.4 of the standard introduced new models for query and response messages. The layout of this chapter is structured such that all information pertaining to those newly defined query/response message pairs, including auxiliary protocols, appears in sections 5.2–5.9 and the previously defined queries appear in section 5.10. Outstanding issues appear in the final section, 5.11.

The Standard embraces the most common queries that are likely to occur. These are defined by the functional chapters. The following represents typical examples of queries supported by the Standard:

{empty}a) data regarding a single patient, e.g., send all lab results for patient #123456

{empty}b) data regarding multiple patients, e.g., send the list of patients whose attending physician is Dr. #123

{empty}c) data that is not patient related, e.g., send the age specific normal values for serum protein.

{empty}d) data within a specified time range, e.g., send all serum glucose results, reported between January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1999, for patient #123456.

The variety of potential queries is almost unlimited. There was no attempt here to define a Standard that would cover every possible query. Chapter 5 discusses general ways query/response pairs are structured. Functional chapters discuss specific query/response pairs required for their needs. The technical committees responsible for functionally-specific chapters define detailed content of the query/response segment patterns within those chapters.

In particular, there is no implication that a specific system SHALL support generalized queries or Conformance Statements to comply with the Standard. Rather, these transactions provide a format, or a set of tools to support queries to the extent desired by the institution. The resources available and local policies will influence the type of queries that MAY BE implemented.
