== QUERY/RESPONSE PROFILE
[v291_section="5.3"]

The introduction of the Query/Response Profilefootnote:[Formerly known as the Conformance Statement, this artifact will be referred to throughout the rest of this document as the *Query Profile* to distinguish it from an implementor assertion of conformance to a particular profile. The Query Profile is understood to include the definition of the appropriate response message(s).] concept is not intended to imply system certification. It is intended to promote the definition and implementation of well-specified queries. As in previous versions, support for queries is not required for HL7 conformance.

In the introduction, the data owner describes the data being made available and the purpose of the query. He specifies the exact coded value for the Query Name which the Client SHALL use to invoke this query.

The Query Grammar defines the exact segments the Client MAY send. For each field of those segments, the Query Profile SHALL define how the Server will interpret client values. (For example, the patient name field is interpreted as a regular expression match.)

The Response Grammar defines the exact pattern of segments that the Server will return. Each Segment Pattern Response will specify its own pattern of segments. (For example, lab data queries will return patterns of OBR and OBX, while demographic queries might respond with patterns of PID, PV1,... segments.) When a data owner defines a tabular response query, the response grammar might simply be a list of RDT segments that carry rows of data. The user selects columns from a Virtual Table to define the output for the Query by Parameter/Tabular Response (QBP/RTB).

[NOTE]
that in the case of an HL7-defined query, a specific section of the HL7 Standard will define a Query Profile. By contrast, in the case of a site defined query, the Query Profile is written by analysts and programmers of the Server application/system, and is available to the analysts and programmers of the Client application/system.

Although the Query Profile was a new construct with Version 2.4, it may also be used with the previous generation queries.

[NOTE]
Version 2.5 introduced a new, use-case-based mechanism for conformance in Chapter 2. Query implementers are encouraged to review and, where appropriate, adopt the profiling structures outlined in that chapter. Current Query Profile structures are retained in Chapter 5 pending revision to the new structures in the next version of the Standard.
