The relationship between placer and filler applications revolves around request messages and response messages to those requests. Placer applications trigger request messages to filler applications, which respond to those requests with request response messages.

The relationship between querying and filler applications focuses on query messages and responses. Querying applications trigger query messages to filler applications, which respond with query response messages.

The relationship between auxiliary and filler applications centers on unsolicited informational messages. Filler applications trigger unsolicited informational messages to auxiliary applications whenever changes in the schedule occur. Auxiliary applications do not respond with any messages other than general acknowledgments. Filler applications triggering unsolicited informational messages do not expect further information from auxiliary applications.
