==== Parent Appointment
[v291_section="10.2.5.7"]

A parent appointment is an appointment that consists of one or more subordinate appointments (called child appointments). A parent appointment is used to relate or group multiple appointments together in various ways. Examples of kinds of parent-scheduled activities include, but are not limited to, the following.

• Recurring (repeating) appointments. For example, a physical therapy appointment may be scheduled every Tuesday at 4:00 PM for three months.

• Batteries of appointments. For example, an activity consisting of an appointment with Radiology, an appointment with a specialist, and an appointment with a primary care physician might be scheduled.

• Complex appointments. For example, recurring batteries of appointments, or batteries of battery appointments.

Parent appointments can themselves be children to other appointments.
