==== The Auxiliary Application Role
[v291_section="10.2.2.4"]

Like querying applications, an auxiliary application neither exerts control over, nor requests changes to a schedule. It, too, is only concerned with gathering information about a particular schedule. It is considered an "interested third-party," in that it is interested in any changes to a particular schedule, but has no interest in changing it or controlling it in any way. An auxiliary application passively collects information by receiving unsolicited updates from a filler application.

The analog of an auxiliary application in a non-automated environment might be any person receiving reports containing schedule information. For example, a facilities manager may need to know what rooms are booked for activity during specific periods of time. This person might ask the person controlling the appointment book for a periodic listing of activity, which may be something as simple as copies of pages from the appointment book.

Often, a placer application will also act as an auxiliary application. A placer application may have the capacity to store information about the scheduled activity that it requested. In such cases, the placer application is also an "interested" application in that it wishes to receive any messages describing changes to the content or status of the scheduled activity it initiated.
