==== OBR field definitions
[v291_section="4.5.3.0"]

The daggered (+) items in this segment are created by the filler, not the placer. They are valued by the filler as needed when the OBR segment is returned as part of a report.

The starred (*) fields are only relevant when an observation is associated with a specimen. These are completed by the placer when the placer obtains the specimen. They are completed by the filler when the filler obtains the specimen.

OBR-7-observation date/time and OBR-8-observation end date/time (flagged with #) are the physiologically relevant times. In the case of an observation on a specimen, they represent the start and end of the specimen collection. In the case of an observation obtained directly from a subject (e.g., BP, Chest X-ray), they represent the start and end time of the observation.
