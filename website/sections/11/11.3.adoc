== PATIENT INFORMATION REQUEST MESSAGES AND TRIGGER EVENTS
[v291_section="11.3"]

Patient information may need to be retrieved from various enterprises. The definition of these enterprises often varies greatly. Some enterprises may be providers or reference laboratories, while others may be payors providing insurance information. In the first case, the message definitions will focus on patient and provider information, while in the latter case, the message definition will deal primarily with patient and subscriber identification.
