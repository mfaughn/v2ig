This query/response is designed for interaction between a client system and an MPI (Master Person Index). The query consists of a set of demographic and/or visit attribute values for a person, and the response is the list of candidates considered by the MPI to match that set.

.Each returned person, specified by a PID segment and by a PV1 segment containing information about the current visit, can also have an optional QRI - Query Response Instance segment containing information about the quality of the match.

|Input Parameter |Comp. Name |DT |Description
|Demographics/VisitFields | |QIP |Components: <segment field name (ST)> ^ <value1 (ST) & value2 (ST) & value3 (ST...>
| | | |Components may be any fields in the PID, PD1, PV1 and/or PV2. If subcomponents of fields need to be specified, each subcomponent should be listed separately.
| | | |Example: ...\|@PID.5.1^SMITH~@PV1.3.2^389~...
|SearchConfidenceThreshold | |NM |Indicates the minimum match confidence for candidates to be returned for the query. The value instructs the queried system to return no records (PID segments) for persons whose “match weight” on the lookup was lower than the user-defined value.
| | | |Example: \|80\|
|AlgorithmName | |ST |Identifies the specific algorithm the queried system should use.
| | | |Example: \|MATCHWARE\|
|AlgorithmVersion | |ST |Identifies the specific algorithm version the queried system should use.
| | | |Example: \|1.2\|
|AlgorithmDescription | |ST |Description of the algorithm the queried system should use.
|WhatDomainsReturned | |CX |Components: <ID (ST)> ^ <check digit (ST)> ^ <code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)> ^ < assigning authority (HD)> ^ <identifier type code (IS)> ^ < assigning facility (HD)
| | | |This parameter restricts the set of domains for which identifiers are returned in PID-3. If this is not specified, then identifiers for all known domains shall be returned. It does not restrict the search for persons.
| | | |Example: ...\|^^^METRO HOSPITAL~^^^SOUTH LAB\|...
| | | |Only the following components should be valued.
|WhatDomainsReturned |Assigning Authority | |PID.3.4 must be valued.

Following is an example of a Q25/K25 query/response pair of messages. First is the query:

RCP||I|20^RD

This query is asking for a list of persons matching the name SMITH who are recorded as being in Room 389. Candidates with a match level above 80 using the algorithm Matchware version 1.2 should be returned. The returned records should include identifiers for assigning authority METRO HOSPITAL. The RCP segment specifies that the number of matches should be limited to 20. Here is a sample response:

QRI|95||MATCHWARE 1.2

One candidate was returned. Notice the 1 at the end of the QAK segment signifying the number of matches. The group of segments includes a PID, PV1, and QRI segment; the QRI segment gives a confidence factor for the candidate.
