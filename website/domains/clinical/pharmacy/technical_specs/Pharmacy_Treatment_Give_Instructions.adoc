When the "give" (i.e., administration) information needs to be transmitted from the pharmacy or treatment application to another application, it is done with the RGV message. The RGV message uses the RXG segment to record drug or treatment administration instructions, which is not contained in an RDS, dispense message. The RGV message may carry information about a single scheduled administration on a drug or treatment, or it may carry information about multiple administrations. If the pharmacy or treatment application (or some other application) needs to create an unambiguous MAR report where each administration is matched to a particular give date/time instruction, it may use the RGV message as described in the following way:

For each scheduled administration of the medication, the pharmacy/treatment issues either a single RGV message or a single RGV message with multiple RXG segments, one for each scheduled administration. The actual administrations (transmitted by one or more RAS messages) are matched against the scheduled ones by recording in each RXA segment the Give Sub-ID of the corresponding RXG segment. If more than one administration needs to be matched (as in the case of recording a change or rate of an IV solution) the administering application issues additional RXA segment(s) (corresponding to the same RXG segment). If no matching is needed, the Give Sub-ID of the RXA segments has the value zero (0).

When used for a scheduled administration or for the start of a continuous administration such as an IV fluid, the ORC must have the filler order number and the order control code RE.

When used for an update to a continuous administration which is currently in progress (e.g. change of rate of an IV fluid), the ORC must have the filler order number and the order control code XO. For these updates the value of RXG-1 Give Sub-ID Counter may be used to provide a unique reference (see section 4A.4.6.1).

The RXE and associated RXCs may be present if the receiving application needs any of their data. The RXG carries the scheduled administration data for either a single "give instruction" (single dose) of medication or for multiple "give instructions." The RXG is not a complete record of an order. Use the RXO and RXE segments if a complete order is needed. It is a record from the pharmacy or treatment application to the Nursing application (or other) with drug/treatment administration instructions.
