In this example, assume that a corporation's telephone system supports a full external telephone number (area code and telephone number). It also supports internal dialing standards that assign a code to each facility and an extension to each telephone (which happens to be the last 4 digits of the external telephone number, by convention).\n> \n> .So, if the Los Angeles facility were assigned code 333, and if the \"outside\" telephone number at the LA office is (626) 555-1234, the components would be:\n> [width=\"100%\",cols=\"42%,58%\",options=\"header\",]\n> |===\n> |Component |Value\n> |area/city code |626\n> |phone number |555-1234\n> |extension |1234\n> |extension prefix |333\n> |===\n> \n> The field would be transmitted as follows:\n> \n> [er7]\n> ^WPN^PH^^^626^5551234^1234^333\n> \n> .Example 3: speed dial. In this example, assume that a corporation's telephone system supports speed dialing numbers. For example, suppose that a corporation has a contract with a travel agency, whose external number is 1-610-555-1234. Since it is so frequently dialed, the company assigns a speed code: #6098. The components would be:\n> [width=\"100%\",cols=\"42%,58%\",options=\"header\",]\n> |===\n> |Component |Value\n> |Area/city code |610\n> |Phone number |555-1234\n> |Speed Dial |#6098\n> |===\n> \n> The field would be transmitted as follows:\n> \n> [er7]\n> ^WPN^PH^^^610^5551234^^^#6098\n> \n> .Example 4: home e-mail address.
