When a referral is inter-enterprise in nature, there are several important relationships that must be identified.

In addition, some enterprises may want information regarding a consulting provider or the identity of the person who actually prepared the referral. This contact role may also expand to represent affiliated persons to whom information regarding this referral must be forwarded or copied.
