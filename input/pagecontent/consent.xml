  <p>In most cases in the health field, consent must be "informed" consent. This means that the consenting individual must understand and appreciate the implications of what they are consenting to. Most consent processes involve providing background material describing the reasons for the proposed service, expected benefits and potential risks. It is important to have a record of what information was presented to the subject at the time of consent.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>The base HL7 v2 standard does not define specific events or message types associated with gathering or sharing patient consent, however the Consent (CON) segment is incorporated into in a variety of message definitions where it can be used for patient consent information sharing related to a particular message.</p>

  <div class="sectionbody">
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Scenario 1: A patient decides to participate in a voluntary electronic drug history program. The patient records this decision in writing (Consent Mode) on a pre-designed consent form (Consent Form ID and Version) after the patient&#8217;s health care service provider has explained the benefits and drawbacks of their participation (Consent Discussion Date/Time). In providing consent, the patient can also decide on the degree to which he or she will participate in the program (Consent Type). The consent decision (Consent Status) is recorded under the patient&#8217;s name (use ROL segment) and the number of the paper-based form that the patient signed is recorded in the electronic consent gathering function (Consent Number). The patient&#8217;s consent is effective from the day of the decision (Consent Effect Date/Time), but this consent can be terminated at the patient&#8217;s discretion at a given date in the future (Consent End Date/Time). Several months later the patient is rushed into an emergency health care facility with what appears to be a drug reaction. While checking the patient&#8217;s drug history, health care service providers find that the patient&#8217;s drug history has controlled access. The patient is unable to provide access to this information given that patient&#8217;s physical state, so the health care service provider circumvents the consent process (Non-consent Access Reason) in the interests of the patient&#8217;s immediate well-being.</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Scenario 2: A patient is seeking a therapeutic abortion. Because she is under 18, the practitioner must evaluate her competence to provide consent. The patient is deemed to be competent (Patient Competence Indicator). Local legislation mandates that the patient be counseled at least 24 hours prior to receiving the procedure. The patient is counseled, and the time recorded (Consent Discussion Date/Time). She is also given a pamphlet to take home and read (Informational Material Supplied Indicator). She returns the following day and signs the consent form (Consent Decision Date/Time).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Scenario 3: A deaf patient is admitted for labor and delivery. It becomes apparent the patient will require a cesarean section. A translator is required (Translator Assistance Indicator) who can translate sign language (Translation Type). The translator explains the details of the procedure the patient is being asked to consent to (Consent Text), the intention to use epidural anesthetic (Subject-specific Consent Text), the general risks associated with doing the procedure, as well as those with not doing the procedure (Background Text) and benefits associated with the epidural (Subject-specific Background Text). The patient agrees to the procedure, subject to the condition that she not be given any blood products for religious reasons (Subject-imposed Limitations).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Scenario 4: An employee signs a consent form authorizing (Consent Status) a hospital to request the employee&#8217;s driving records from the local Department of Motor Vehicles (Consent Type).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Scenario 5: A patient signs a consent form to have basic diagnostic and billing information sent to that patient&#8217;s insurer. The consent indicates that information may only be given to parties that are bound by HIPPA guidelines (Trust Agreement Restriction Type).</p>
