  <p>The Patient Administration transaction set provides for the transmission of new or updated demographic and visit information about patients.

  <p>Generally, information is entered into a Patient Administration system and passed to the nursing, ancillary and financial systems either in the form of an unsolicited update or a response to a record-oriented query.</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>The term "identifier" is used throughout this section. An identifier is associated with a set (or sets) of data. For example, an identifier (<em>PID-3 - Patient Identifier List</em>) may be a medical record number which has associated with it account numbers (<em>PID-18 - Patient Account Number</em>). Account number (<em>PID-18 - Patient Account Number</em>) is a type of identifier which may have associated with it visit numbers (<em>PV1-19 - Visit Number</em>).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>This section addresses the events that occur usually for the purposes of correcting errors in person, patient, account, or visit identifiers. The types of errors that occur typically fall into three categories:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>1) <strong>Duplicate identifier created</strong><br>
  The registrar fails to identify an existing person, patient, account, or visit and creates a new, "duplicate" record instead of using the existing record. A "merge" operation is used to fix this type of error.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>2) <strong>Incorrect identifier selected</strong><br>
  The registrar mistakenly selects the wrong person, patient, or account and creates or attaches a patient, account, or visit underneath the incorrect person, patient, or account. A "move" operation is used to fix this type of error.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>3) <strong>Incorrect identifier assigned</strong><br>
  The registrar accidentally types in the wrong new identifier for a person, patient, account, or visit. This type of mistake usually occurs when identifiers are manually assigned (not system generated). A "change identifier" operation is used to fix this type of error.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="sect4">
  <h5 id="_hierarchy_of_identifiers">Hierarchy of Identifiers</h5>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>This section was written from the perspective of one controlling MPI and does not adequately cover the implementation of peer MPIs or multiple enterprise identifiers. To avoid future problems implementors should carefully examine the inferences of multiple identifiers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Enterprise level MPI systems may collaborate forming either peer-to-peer or hierarchical relationships. When this occurs, multiple enterprise level identifiers may be required in the context of a single HL7 message. An example of a peer-to-peer MPI relationship might be represented by a data sharing application between the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the US Department of Defense, where each have their own MPI. An example of a hierarchical MPI relationship might be required by the need for local, city, and state organizations to collaborate, where each have an MPI.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>These events assume a hierarchy of identifiers exists between person, patient, account, and visit. The hierarchy is as follows:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Level 3 - Patient (identified by <em>PID-3 - Patient Identifier List</em>)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Level 2 - Account (identified by <em>PID-18 - Patient Account Number</em>)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Level 1 - Visit (identified by <em>PV1-19 - Visit Number</em>)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>The visit-level identifier <em>PV1-19 - Visit Number</em> is the lowest level identifier and is considered subordinate to the account-level identifier <em>PID-18 - Patient Account Number</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>This means that visit identifiers are defined within the context of an account identifier, and implies that visit identifiers are unique within account identifiers. Similarly, account identifiers are subordinate to, and unique within, patient identifiers; patient identifiers are subordinate to, and unique within, person identifiers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Conversely, the person-level identifier is the highest-level identifier and is considered superior to the patient-level identifiers, which are superior to the account-level identifier, which is superior to any visit-level identifiers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Note that these events will also apply to environments in which one or more of these levels do not occur. For example, some environments may not have a person (or MPI) level, or they may not have a visit level, or they may have a visit level without an account level. The hierarchy concept is depicted graphically below. For example, Adam Everyman might be assigned an MPI number at the Good Health Hospital network (depicted by the circle). He may have different medical records at two hospitals within the network (depicted by the squares). Associated with each of these medical records are two accounts (depicted by the triangles). Note that the environment illustrated does not support the "visit" level, although in other implementations it might.</p>

  <h5 id="_merge">Merge</h5>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>A merge event signals that two distinct records have been combined together into a single record with a single set of identifiers and data surviving at the level of the merge. All records at a level subordinate to the merged identifier are combined under the surviving record. For example, an A40 (merge patient - patient identifier list) event would be sent to signal that two person records (identified by <em>MRG-1 - Prior Patient ID</em> and by <em>PID-3 - Patient ID</em>) have been merged into a single record. All of the identifiers, accounts, and visits under the person record are not merged together - they are instead combined under the same person record. The following figure graphically depicts the merge event:</p>

  It is not the intent of the merge definition to define the application or implementation specifics of how various systems or environments define, use or handle non-surviving information. "Non-surviving" in this document implies that a data set was existing in a fashion that was incorrect. Merging it into a new data set in itself implies that where there were two datasets, there is now only one. The means by which any system or environment conveys this new data set and the absence of the previous data set to the user is application specific. It is noted that some systems may still physically keep these "incorrect" datasets for audit trail or other purposes.

  <h5 id="_move">Move</h5>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>A "move" involves transferring one or more datasets (identified by a subordinate identifier) from one superior identifier at the next hierarchical level to another superior identifier at the next hierarchical level, while all identifiers involved retain their original value. An exception to retaining the original identifier value may occur if any of the subordinate source identifiers already exist under the target superior identifier. In this case the identifier value may have to be renumbered in order to be uniquely identified under the target superior identifier. (Refer to section <em>3.6.2.2.8</em>, "link:#<em>A45</em>-<em>move_visit information - visi[_A45 - Move visit information</em>]" for an illustration of this.)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>A move event signals that a patient, account, or visit has been moved from one person, patient, or account, respectively, to another. All records at a subordinate level are also moved. For example, an A43 (move patient information - patient identifier list) event would be sent to signal that a medical records administrator has moved a medical record attached to an incorrect person to a correct person. The following figure graphically depicts the move event:</p>

  The move event implies that all data related to the incorrect source ID and its subordinate IDs (specified in the MRG segment) will be moved to the correct target ID (specified in the PID or PV1 segment). Specifying each subordinate ID in repeating PID/MRG/PV1 sets is optional but not recommended.

  <h5 id="_change_identifier">Change identifier</h5>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>A change identifier event signals that a single person, patient, account, or visit identifier has been changed. It does not reflect a merge or a move; it is simply a change of an identifier. For example, a "Change Identifier" event would be sent to signal that the registrar has changed an incorrectly assigned person identifier to a correct person identifier. The following picture graphically depicts this event:</p>

  <h5 id="_source_and_target_identifiers">Source and target identifiers</h5>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Merge, move, and change events reference target and source identifiers. The incorrect source identifier is specified in the MRG segment. The correct target identifier is identified in the PID or PV1 segment. For example, when you are changing a patient account number the source would be <em>MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number</em>. The target is <em>PID-18 - Patient Account Number</em>.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sect4">
  <h5 id="_tightly_coupled_relationship">Tightly coupled relationship</h5>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>When patient/person identifiers are the target in merge, move, or change events, as specified in the <em>PID-2 - Patient ID</em>, <em>PID-3 - Patient Identifier List</em> and <em>PID-4 - Alternate Patient ID-PID</em>, the associated source identifiers in the <em>MRG-4 - Prior Patient ID</em>, <em>MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List</em>, and <em>MRG-2 - Prior Alternate Patient ID</em>, respectively, must be "tightly coupled." Each event that is defined as a merge, move, or change message carries the "tightly" coupled relationship at the appropriate level in one of two ways: first, by virtue of positional placement in the sequence of identifiers; or, second, by identifier type and assigning authority. The methodology used to establish the definition of "tightly coupled" relationship is determined by site negotiation. The recommended definition is by virtue of positional placement in the sequence of identifiers (pairwise). In addition, HL7 allows the use of the second definition by identifier type and assigning authority as an acceptable convention to establish a "tightly coupled" relationship. In the absence of a site negotiated definition, it is assumed that the positional placement of the identifiers is the default method.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>The list of identifiers can be aligned positionally in their respective segment fields and processed by the receiving system by virtue of their order. This is sometimes referred to as an "ordered pairwise" relationship and is described further in section <em>3.6.2.1.7</em>, "<a href="#ordered-pairwise-relationship"><em>Ordered pairwise relationship</em></a>".</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Alternatively, the uniqueness of the identifiers included in the message is determined by the combination of identifier type and assigning authority. It is assumed that both sending system and receiving system can inspect both of these qualifiers as a message is constructed or processed to determine the "tightly coupled" relationship between the identifiers. This can be referred to as "identifier type/assigning authority" relationship and is described further in section <em>3.6.2.1.8</em>, "link:#<em>Identifier_type</em>/<em>assigning authori[_Identifier type/assigning authority relationship</em>]".</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>A flexible message construct is provided for merge trigger events. The message construct allows for a repeating set of PID, optional PD1, MRG, and optional PV1 segments as illustrated below:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>MSH</p>

  <div class="paragraph">

  <p>MRG</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>[PV1]</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>}</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Trigger events support the concept of a global move or merge, where all the subordinate identifiers are moved or merged. For example, the use case for A41 (merge account-patient account number) (Section <em>3.6.2.2.3</em>, "<em>A41 - merge account - patient account number (global)</em>") illustrates a merge on the patient account number (<em>PID-18 - Patient Account Number</em>). All subordinate identifiers (<em>PV1-19 - Visit Number</em>) are moved to the target <em>PID-18 - Patient Account Number Identifier</em>, even though they are not specified in the message.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>A repeating segment message construct supports reporting of the subordinate identifiers using the repeating segments. This is illustrated in the use case for A40 (merge patient - patient identifier list) (Section <em>3.6.2.2.2</em>, "<em>A40 - merge patient - patient identifier list (repeating segment)</em>," A41 (merge account - patient account number) (Section <em>3.6.2.2.4</em>, "<em>A41 - merge account - patient account number (repeating segment)</em>"), and A45 (move visit information-visit number) (Section <em>3.6.2.2.9</em> "<em>A45 - move visit information - visit number (repeating segment)</em>"). Specifying each subordinate ID in repeating segments is optional but not recommended. This construct can be used when renumbering of identifiers is necessary as illustrated in Sections <em>3.6.2.2.2</em>, "<em>A40 - merge patient - patient identifier list (repeating segment)</em>," <em>3.6.2.2.4</em>, "<em>A41 - merge account - patient account number (repeating segment)</em>," and <em>3.6.2.2.9</em>, "<em>A45 - move visit information - visit number (repeating segment)</em>," or to explicitly identify individual subordinate identifiers as illustrated in Section <em>3.6.2.2.9</em>, "<em>A45 - move visit information - visit number (repeating segment)</em>."</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sect4">
  <h5 id="_identifier_renumbering">Identifier renumbering</h5>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>When renumbering of identifiers occurs, the repeating segment construct may be required in order to report identifier number changes. When renumbering occurs, the incorrect source identifier is specified in the MRG segment and the correct target identifier is reported in the PID or PV1 segment. Refer to the use case for A41 (merge account-patient account number) for an illustration.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sect4">
  <h5 id="_superior_identifier_reporting">Superior identifier reporting</h5>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>When merging or moving subordinate numbers, the higher level, "superior" identifiers should be included in the message. For example, when merging an account where the target is <em>PID-18 - Patient Account Number</em> and the source is <em>MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number</em>, the higher level patient identifiers (<em>PID-3 -Patient Identifier List</em> and <em>MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List</em>) and person identifiers (<em>PID-2 - Patient ID</em> and <em>MRG-4 - Prior Patient ID</em>) should also be reported in the message.</p>

  <div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_trigger_events">Trigger events</h4>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>The intent of trigger events A40 (merge patient- patient identifier list), A41 (merge account-patient account number), A42 (merge visit-visit number), A43 (move patient information-patient identifier list), A44 (move account information-patient account number), A45 (move visit information-visit number), A47 (change patient identifier list), A49 (change patient account number), A50 (change visit number), and A51 (change alternate visit ID) is to reconcile distinct sets of existing person/patient data records that have been entered under different identification numbers, either deliberately or because of errors. Ideally, following any of these trigger events, all of the person/patient data should be accessible under whatever surviving identifiers were specified in the messages. Because of substantial differences in database architectures and system-dependent data processing requirements or limitations, the exact meaning and implementation of these events must be negotiated between systems.</p>

  <p>Linking two or more patients does not require the actual merging of patient information as discussed in Section <a href="#merging-patientperson-information"><em>3.6.2</em></a>, "<a href="#merging-patientperson-information"><em>Merging patient/person information</em></a>;" following a link trigger event, sets of affected patient data records should remain distinct. However, because of differences in database architectures, there may be system-dependent limitations or restrictions regarding the linking of one or more patients that must be negotiated.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>There are multiple approaches for implementing Master Patient Indexes. It is useful for the purpose of MPI mediation to support two types of linkage. Explicit linkage requires a message declaring a link has been made between multiple identifiers. Implicit linkage is performed when a receiving system infers the linkage from the presence of multiple identifiers present in <em>PID-3 - Patient Identifier List</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>In an MPI setting, the A24 -link patient information message is preferred for transmitting an explicit link of identifiers whether they are in the same or different assigning authorities. The A37 unlink patient information message is preferred for transmitting the explicit unlinking of identifiers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Implicit linkage of identifiers, sometimes called passive linking, has been implemented using various messages. An acknowledged method is inclusion of multiple identifiers in <em>PID-3 - Patient Identifier List</em>, which the receiving system implicitly links. An MPI or application that makes such an implicit linkage can generate an A24 - link patient information message to explicitly notify another system of this action.</p>

  <h4 id="_definitions_what_is_an_mpi">Definitions - what is an MPI?</h4>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>There can be quite a bit of confusion as to what defines an MPI. Early definitions called it a Master Patient Index, implying only patient data would be managed. Later the definition was expanded to mean persons in general, including patients, guarantors, subscribers, and even providers; essentially any entity that could be considered a "person." Thus the current acronym MPI generally is inferred to mean Master Person Index.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>An MPI is generally used to manage person identification and cross-reference across disparate systems. Healthcare organizations may have several systems handling various different data processing needs, from laboratory to billing, each with its own database of persons and person identifier numbering schemes. Each of these can be called an ID Domain. An MPI can function as a Correlation Manager between these domains, providing a cross-reference of a person&#8217;s identifiers across each of the domains. Typically an MPI will also have one universal or enterprise identifier that uniquely identifies the person in the MPI itself. The domain for this identifier may or may not be the domain for clients of the MPI.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>MPI functionality also typically includes methods to provide an identifier for a person, given a set of traits or demographics for that person. An example of the use of this is for a client system to query the MPI for a person given a set of demographics. The MPI uses matching algorithms to find possible matching persons, and returns to the client system the identifiers for those persons.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>This section currently deals only with MPI functionality related to persons in the context of Version 2.4 and later. It is assuming integration using Version 2.4 and later ADT messages, and the functionality surrounding finding and identifying a person.</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>The following sections show several scenarios involving looking up a person on a "client" system, and how it can be integrated to an MPI. The basic flow is for a user to enter person information on the client system, and the client system using services of the MPI to match the user&#8217;s input to a person that exists somewhere on the two systems.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>The scenarios are differentiated on two variables:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p><strong>ID Creator -</strong> Which system assigns new person identifiers for the client system. This can either be the MPI or the client system.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p><strong>Person Existence -</strong> On which system the person record currently exists - the client system, the MPI, or both.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_client_system_assigns_identifier_person_exists_on_mpi_only">Client system assigns identifier, person exists on MPI only</h4>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>In this scenario, a client system (e.g., a registration system) will query an MPI for a person that does not currently exist on the client system. The MPI returns a list of one or more possible matching candidates, and one is chosen by the user on the client system. The client system assigns the person an identifier and an update is sent to the MPI to notify it of the new assigned identifier.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <div class="title">Client system assigns identifier, person exists on MPI only</div>
  <p><span class="image"><img src="assign_identifier_1.png" alt="assign_identifier_1"></span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>The messages are defined as follows:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p><strong>Q22/K22 Find Candidates</strong> - This signals the MPI to search its database for a list of persons that match the demographic criteria sent in the query, using whatever algorithms it has at its disposal, or using the algorithm optionally specified in the query. The response includes a list of "candidates" that matched the criteria in the query, one PID segment for each candidate. The query can also specify the identifier domains to return in <em>PID-3 - Patient Identifier List</em>, so that the client system identifier and the MPI enterprise identifier could be returned for each match.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p><strong>Q21/K21 Get Person Demographics</strong> - Once a candidate is chosen from the list, another query may be done to retrieve the full set of demographics for that person.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p><strong>A24 or A01/A04/A05</strong> - This transaction is to update the MPI with the new identifier the client system has created for the person. It is acceptable for systems to simply send <em>an A01 Admit/visit notification,</em> <em>A04 Register a patient or A05 Pre-admit a patient</em> as may have been done traditionally, with the new client system identifier and the existing MPI enterprise identifier in PID-3. However an <em>A24 Link patient information</em> may be sent instead, with one PID segment containing the MPI enterprise identifier for the person, and the second PID segment containing the new registration system identifier.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_client_system_assigns_identifier_person_exists_on_both_systems">Client system assigns identifier, person exists on both systems</h4>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>In this scenario, a client system (e.g., a registration system) will query an MPI for a person, and the person record exists on both systems. The MPI returns a list of possible matching candidates, and one is chosen by the user on the client system. The client system simply asks the MPI for an updated set of demographics and does not assign an identifier since the person already exists with an identifier on the client system.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Prior to querying the MPI, the client system may query its own database to reduce network transactions. However, the full searching capabilities of the MPI may be preferred to the client system in order to prevent the selection of the wrong person.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <div class="title">Client system assigns identifier, person exists on both systems</div>
  <p><span class="image"><img src="assign_identifier_2.png" alt="assign_identifier_2" width="504" height="480"></span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>The message flow is identical to the message flow in the 3.6.4.5 example, with the exception that the final update to the MPI is not needed in order to give the MPI a new identifier for the person. The MPI should already have the client system identifier from previous transactions.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>An ADT event may be sent later by the client system simply to update the MPI with any demographic changes that occur.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_client_system_assigns_identifier_person_exists_on_neither_system">Client system assigns identifier, person exists on neither system</h4>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>In this scenario, a client system (e.g., a registration system) will query an MPI for a person, and the person does not exist on either system. The MPI returns a list of possible matching candidates, or possibly an empty list. The user does <em>not</em> choose one, and a new person record is created.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <div class="title">Client system assigns identifier, does not exist on either system</div>
  <p><span class="image"><img src="assign_identifier_3.png" alt="assign_identifier_3" width="584" height="440"></span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>The message flow again begins with a <em>Q22/K22</em> <em>Find Candidates</em> query. The response may or may not contain a list of candidates.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>If the client system assigns a person identifier when the record is created, an <em>A28 Add person information</em> could be sent to the MPI to notify it of the record creation. If the client system does not create an identifier until the registration is completed, the A01, A04 or A05 events could serve the purpose of notifying the MPI of an added person and identifier. The fact that the person will have an identifier unknown to the MPI, and no enterprise identifier, will allow the MPI to infer that a person record is being added.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>When the person record is added to the MPI with the new identifier, an enterprise identifier is assigned, and ancillary systems may be notified of the new person record creation.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sect3">
  <h4 id="_mpi_assigns_identifier_person_exists_on_mpi">MPI assigns identifier, person exists on MPI</h4>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>In the next set of three scenarios, it is assumed that a third party (ID Manager) creates identifiers for the client system, and for these examples the MPI fulfills this role. The QBP/RSP queries support this service.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <div class="title">Example of two healthcare organizations merging</div>
  <p><span class="image"><img src="assign_identifier_4.png" alt="assign_identifier_4" width="624" height="304"></span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Figure 3-4 shows a case where identifiers may need to be assigned by a third party. In the example, East Health Organization had one identifier domain (XXXX numbers) for both the hospital registration system and the outpatient clinic registration numbers. Coordination was done through the use of pre-printed charts for new patients, which prevented the two systems from using the same XXXX number for two patients.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Later West Health Organization is bought and merged with East. West has been using its own identifier domain (YYYY numbers). An MPI is also implemented to keep a cross-reference between the two systems, and assigns its own enterprise identifier (EEEE number) to each patient.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Because the organization is attempting to go paperless, East decides to forgo its pre-printed charts, but still keep the XXXX numbers. Since the pre-printed charts are no longer there to keep numbers from being re-used between the hospital and clinic, a third party is needed to assign the XXXX numbers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>A patient arrives at East Hospital that had never been there, but had been to West previously. To register the patient, the hospital system submits a Find Candidates Q22/K22 query to get from the MPI a list of possible matching patients. The user finds the patient since she had been to West previously. Since the patient is new to East, she must be given a new East identifier (XXXX number). An Allocate Identifiers A56/K24 query is sent from the East Hospital to the MPI and the MPI generates an XXXX number and returns it. Later when the registration is finished, an A24 Link Person Information message is sent to notify the MPI that the allocated identifier has been assigned to a patient</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>In the following first scenario, the person record exists on the MPI, however it does not exist on the client system. The message flow assumes that the MPI is assigning identifiers for the client system that are not the enterprise identifiers. If this were not the case, the Allocate Identifiers A56/K24 query would not be needed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <div class="title">MPI assigns identifier, person exists on MPI</div>
  <p><span class="image"><img src="assign_identifier_5.png" alt="assign_identifier_5"></span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>The message flow is similar to previous examples, with the exception of the <em>Q24/K24 Allocate Identifiers</em> query and the final <em>A24 Link Patient Information</em> message:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p><strong>Q24/K24 Allocate Identifiers</strong> - This query is for the client system to ask the MPI for an identifier in the client system&#8217;s domain. It is not to assign the identifier to a particular person record, but rather just to reserve an identifier for later use.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  <p><strong>A24 Link patient information</strong> - This message is to notify the MPI that the previously allocated identifier has been assigned to a person. The A24 should include one PID segment with the new identifier and one PID segment with the MPI enterprise identifier.</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>In this scenario, the person does not exist on either system. The message flow is similar to <em>3.6.4.7</em>, "<em>MPI assigns identifier, person exists on MPI</em>"; however, there is no need for the <em>Q21/K21Get person Demographics</em> query as a double-check for the user since the person does not exist on the MPI. Also, after the person is registered and the identifier assigned, an <em>A28 Add Person Information</em> is sent to the MPI to have it add the person to its database and assign an enterprise identifier.</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>The species attribute is required for non-human patients. The breed and strain attributes are conditional. Thus if the strain attribute is populated, the species attribute must be populated, but the breed attribute is optional. The production class attribute is optional, but if populated the species attribute must also be populated. The name of the animal populates the PID-5 attribute, component 2. The last name of the owner may populate component 1 of PID-5. Owner information is transmitted in the NK1 segment.</p>
