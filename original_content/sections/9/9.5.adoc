[v291_section="9.5"]

Within this section we have created a single message whose contents vary predicated on the trigger event. The following assumptions are made when the Medical Document Management (MDM) message is used:

• The application system is responsible for meeting all legal requirements (on the local, state, and federal levels) in the areas of document authentication, confidentiality, and retention.

• All documents are unique, and document numbers and file names are not reused.

• Documents may be associated with one or more orders.
