In most cases in the health field, consent must be "informed" consent. This means that the consenting individual must understand and appreciate the implications of what he or she is consenting to. Most consent processes involve providing background material describing the reasons for the proposed service, expected benefits and potential risks. It is important to have a record of what information was presented to the subject at the time of consent.
