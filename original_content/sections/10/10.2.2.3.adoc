==== The Querying Application Role
[v291_section="10.2.2.3"]

A querying application neither exerts control over, nor requests changes to a schedule. Rather than accepting unsolicited information about schedules, as does an auxiliary application, the querying application actively solicits this information using a query mechanism. It will, in general, be driven by a person wanting information about schedules, and may be part of an application filling the placer application role as defined in this chapter. The information that the querying application receives is valid only at the exact time that the query results are generated by the filler application. Changes made to the schedule after the query results have been returned are not communicated to the querying application until it issues another query transaction.

The analog of a querying application in a non-automated environment might be any person needing information about a specific portion of a schedule. For example, a facilities manager may need to know whether a specific room has been scheduled during a specific period of time. This person might ask the person controlling the appointment book about the specific room and period of time in question.

Often, a placer application will also act as a querying application. The ability to send queries and receive lists of open slots is built in to some implementations of placer applications. These placer applications use this information to select open slots for subsequent booking requests. The current specification does not imply that placer applications should or should not also be able to fulfill the role of a querying application. Instead, the model defines these roles separately. Applications that support this functionality may take advantage of this application role in the model. Applications that do not support the querying application role are not limited in their support of the placer application role.
