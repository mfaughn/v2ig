==== The Placer Application Role
[v291_section="10.2.2.2"]

The placer application role in the scheduling model is also very similar to its counterpart in the Order Entry chapter. A placer application requests the booking, modification, cancellation, etc., of a scheduled activity for a service or resource. Because it cannot exert any control over the schedule for that resource, it must send its requests to modify the schedule to the filler application. In requesting that these appointments be booked or modified in some way, the placer application is asking the filler application to exert its control over the schedule on the placer application's behalf.

The analog of a placer application in a non-automated environment might be any person needing a particular resource or appointment for a service. A person needing to book an appointment would contact the person in charge of the appointment book for that resource or service, and request a reservation. Often, there is negotiation between the person requesting the reservation or appointment and the person who maintains the appointment book. The requesting person will indicate requirements and preferences, and the person controlling the appointment book will indicate whether the request can be fulfilled as specified.
