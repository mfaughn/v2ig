=== IV solution groups
[v291_section="4A.3.2"]

An order for a group of IV solutions to be given sequentially can be supported in two similar ways: Parent/Child and Separate Orders. This HL7 Standard supports both methods of ordering. The method used at a particular site must be negotiated between the site institution and the various application vendors. See Chapter 2, section 2.A.53 OSD Order Sequence Definition, "Use Case 1 Cyclic placer order groups," for further details.
