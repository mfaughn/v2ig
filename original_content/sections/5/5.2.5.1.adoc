==== Expressing the same data using the variants
[v291_section="5.2.5.1"]

The following is an example of a query stated in all three variant forms. This example is presented to illustrate the utility of each format for the purpose of offering a query. Which format to use depends upon the level of processing complexity to be implemented on the Server and the degree of specification flexibility required by the Client.

The purpose of the query is to allow a simple inquiry upon an administrative database. Suppose a patient information request is submitted by the Client. The Server is to respond with demographic information: patient's date of birth, sex, and ZIP code.
