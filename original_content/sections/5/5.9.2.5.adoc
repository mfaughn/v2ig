==== Lab example different instantiation
[v291_section="5.9.2.5"]

The same Query Name might be invoked with a different query tag (456) as follows:

The user wishes to know all the lab results reported having a LOINC code of 6777-7 between March 21, 1999 and March 23, 1999.

The second instance of the "Lab Results for Specified Criteria" query would clearly return quite different results than the first even though both are invocations of the same query.
