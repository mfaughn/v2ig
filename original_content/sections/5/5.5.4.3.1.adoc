===== Note on QPD usage for query by example variant.
[v291_section="5.5.4.3.1"]

[NOTE]
Query By Example: The Query by Example is an extension of Query by Parameter (QBP) in which search parameters are passed by sending them in the segment which naturally carries them. Thus if one wanted to perform a "find_candidates" query using query by example, one would send the demographics information on which to search in the PID and/or PD1 segments leaving blank those fields in the segment sent which are not query parameters. If, for example, religion were not one of the query parameters, PID-17 would be left blank when the PID was sent in the query. Parameters which do not occur naturally in an HL7 message, such as search algorithm, confidence level, etc, would continue to be carried in the QPD segment as they are in the Query by Parameter. The segments and fields available for use as query parameters would be specified in the Query Profile for the query.
