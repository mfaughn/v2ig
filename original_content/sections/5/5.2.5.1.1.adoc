As we have seen, this variant requires an exact parameter specification.

The client system transmits a QBP query message in the following format:

[er7]
MSH|^~\&|FEH.IVR|HUHA.CSC|HUHA.DEMO||199902031135-0600||QBP^Z58^QBP_Q13|1|D|2.8
[er7]
QPD|Z58^Pat Parm Qry 2|Q502|111069999

RCP|I

The names of the input and output fields are not specified in the query message, but by the Query Profile, identified by _QPD-1-message query name_. The _MSH-9.2-trigger event_ and the _QPD-1-message query name_ are this query's only distinguishing elements. The requesting system SHALL refer to this query's Query Profile to learn more about the input and output fields.
