=== RQI Message Using an I01 Event with an Immediate Response
[v291_section="11.9.1"]

When a patient arrives for an appointment, the office staff will frequently need to verify the patient's insurance information. In the following RQI message example, Dr. Hippocrates is sending an insurance information request to the H. C. Payor Insurance Company for his patient, Adam A. Everyman. The response from the payor is shown in a more complete IN1 segment. However, it should be noted that in addition to the IN1 segment, this return information could have been placed in the NTE segment to serve as display data. This strategy would serve a broader community of diverse application systems that might have different levels of ability to process the record-formatted data.
