The HL7 Working Group is composed of volunteers who give their time on a personal basis or under sponsorship of their employers. Published standards (including this HL7 V2.9 Standard) and other products are freely available to everyone who registers and agrees to the terms of HL7's IP policy. Members have the added advantage of having access to all materials immediately upon publication while, in general, non-members must wait three months from the date of publicat to access materials. In addition, members have the right to use HL7 standards in their products and to create derivitive works; non-members have the right to read the standards, but not use them in their products. Those wishing more information are referred to the IP Compliance policy on HL7's web site at http://www.hl7.org/legal/ippolicy.cfm[hl7.org/legal/ippolicy.cfm].

Membership in the HL7 Working Group has been, and continues to be, open to anyone wishing to volunteer and contribute to the development and refinement of any HL7 Working Group Standard and the work that supports those Standards.

The term “Level 7” refers to the highest implementation protocol level for a definition of a networking framework as presented in the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model of the International Standards Organization (ISO) and CCITT (French Acronym for the Consultive Committee for Interntational Telephone and Telegraph). This is not to say that HL7 conforms to ISO-defined elements of the OSI’s seventh level. Also, HL7 does not specify a set of ISO-approved specifications to occupy layers 1 to 6 under HL7’s abstract message specifications. HL7 does, however, correspond to the conceptual definition of an application‑to‑application interface placed in the seventh layer of the OSI model.

In the OSI conceptual model, the functions of both communications software and hardware are separated into seven layers, or levels. The HL7 Standard is primarily focused on the issues that occur within the seventh, or application, level. These are the definitions of the data to be exchanged, the timing of the exchanges, and the communication of certain application-specific errors between the applications. However, of necessity (or at least in an attempt to be clear), protocols that refer to the lower layers of the OSI model are sometimes mentioned to help implementers understand the context of the Standard. They are also sometimes specified to assist implementers in establishing working HL7-based systems.

The HL7 Version 2 Standard currently addresses the interfaces among various healthcare IT systems that send or receive patient admissions/registration, discharge or transfer (ADT) data, queries, resource and patient scheduling, orders, results, clinical observations, billing, master file update information, medical records, scheduling, patient referral, patient care, clinical laboratory automation, application management and personnel management messages. *It does not try to assume a particular architecture with respect to the placement of data within applications. Instead, HL7 Version 2.9.1 serves as a way for inherently disparate applications and data architectures operating in a heterogeneous system environment to communicate with each other*. As an example, HL7 Version 2.9.1 is designed (and used) to support a central patient care system as well as a more distributed environment where data resides in departmental systems.

If we consider the multitude of healthcare information systems applications as well as the variety of environments in which healthcare is delivered, it is evident that there are many more interfaces that could benefit from standardization. The interfaces chosen were considered to be of high priority by the members participating in the standards writing process. HL7’s intent is for Version 2.9 to be a complete standard for these interfaces, built on a generic framework that is sufficiently robust to support many other interfaces. The HL7 Version 2.x family of standards has been put into production and is being used as a basis for extending the existing interface definitions and also adding other definitions.

It is expected that one result of publishing this specification will be the recruitment of more Working Group members with special interests in some newer and not yet fully specified areas. Some of the areas that have already been identified are:

{empty}a) decision support

{empty}b) additional specific ancillary departments

{empty}c) information needs associated with healthcare delivery systems outside of the acute care setting

{empty}d) clinical genomics

{empty}e) pediatrics

{empty}f) emergency medicine

The above notwithstanding, the Working Group members feel that the interfaces addressed here are sufficient to provide significant benefits to the healthcare community. Active Work Groups exist for the domain areas listed above. All interest in contribution to future development of this Standard, these specified growth areas or any other areas of Medicin or Health Information Technology are welcome to join HL7 and work with us.

This document is structured as follows. The balance of this chapter contains a rationale for developing the HL7 Version 2.9 Standard, the goals of the Standard, and issues that have been considered by the Working Group pertaining to scope and operational approach. It is hoped that this will help the readers understand the basis for decisions that have been made in developing the Standard. Subsequent chapters specify, respectively:

 Chapter 2 – Control – overall structure for all interfaces including a generalized query interface.

 Chapter 2A – Data Types – provides definitions for all HL7 V2 data types.

 Chapter 2B – Conformance – using message profiles for conformance.

 Chapter 2C-Code Tables – a listing of all tables of information used in the standard.

 Chapter 3 – Patient Administration - admission, discharge, transfer and registration

 Chapter 4 – Order Entry – messages for the transmission of orders or information about orders between applications that capture the order, by those that fulfill the order, and other applications as needed. These services include medications from the pharmacy, clinical observations (e.g., vitals, I&Os) from the nursing service, tests in the laboratory, food from dietary, films from radiology, linens from housekeeping, supplies from central supply, an order to give a medication (as opposed to delivering it to the ward), etc.

 Chapter 4A – Order Entry: Pharmacy/Treatment, Vaccination – messages for the transmission of orders or information about orders specific to pharmacy/treatment and vaccines.

 Chapter 5 – Query - defines the rules that apply to queries and to their responses.

 Chapter 6 – Financial Management - patient accounting (billing) systems

 Chapter 7 – Observation Reporting – clinical observation data, such as laboratory results, that are sent as identifiable data elements (rather than display-oriented text)

 Chapter 8 – Master Files – a generalized interface for synchronizing common reference files (master files)

 Chapter 9 – Medical Records/Information Management – medical information management

 Chapter 10 – Scheduling – patient and resource scheduling

 Chapter 11- Patient Referral – patient referral messages for referring a patient between two institutions

 Chapter 12 – Patient Care - patient care messages that support communication of problem-oriented records, and to provide functionality for the implementation of clinical pathways in computer information systems

 Chapter 13 - Clinical Laboratory Automation – messages that communicate information essential for a Laboratory Automation System (LAS) to control the various processes and to ensure that each specimen or aliquot has the correct tests performed in the proper sequence.

 Chapter 14 – Application Management - messages that provide a means to manage HL7-supporting applications over a network

 Chapter 15 – Personnel Management – messages for transmitting new or updated administration information about individual healthcare practitioners and supporting staff members.

 Chapter 16 – messages to support Claims and Reimbursement (CR) for the electronic exchange of health invoice (claim) data outside of the US.

 Chapter 17 – Materials Management – messages for communicating various events related to the transactions derived from supply chain management within a healthcare facility.
