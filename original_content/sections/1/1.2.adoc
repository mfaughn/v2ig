[v291_section="1.2"]

This document contains the specifications for Version 2.9.1 of the Health Level Seven (HL7) Standard for electronic data exchange in all healthcare environments, with special emphasis on inpatient acute care facilities (i.e., hospitals). It summarizes the work of a committee of healthcare providers (i.e., users), vendors and consultants established in March 1987 on the occasion of a conference hosted by Dr. Sam Schultz at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Its participants, who represent users as well as vendors and a wide variety of other segments in the international healthcare market, share a common goal of simplifying the implementation of interfaces between computer applications from different, and often competing, vendors. This committee, which subsequently became known as the HL7 Working Group, endeavors to standardize the format and protocol for the exchange of certain key sets of data among healthcare computer application systems. Meetings are held approximately every four months in scattered locations throughout the United States, and, increasingly, in international locations. At present, HL7 sanctioned national groups exist outside of the United States, including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bosnia, Brazil, Canada, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Herzegovina, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Phillippines, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, The Netherlands, Turkey, The United Kingdom and Uruguay.

This document is being presented to interested parties. It is a status report that is periodically published to solicit the involvement of the broadest possible group of participants as this protocol is being put into use. Comments are solicited on all aspects of this and other HL7 Standards.

HL7 Version 2.9.1 represents HL7’s latest development efforts to the line of Version 2 Standards (Version 2.x) that date back to 1989. HL7 Version 2.9.1 is deemed necessary to incorporate changes required by work groups, regulation changes, and new requirements of membership, as demonstrated by proposals submitted. Affected chapters were updated with respect to new requirements for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) expression. Technical corrections were applied, and _in addition, the proposed changes are modifications or additions to the Chapter 2C, Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter 4A, Chapters 6-12 and Chapters 15-16_.  

{empty}a) General

{empty}a. In all product families there is debate around use of observations to represent the Gender Harmony concepts. In order to support immediate exchange of Gender Harmony concepts a SOGI profile component using the existing base standard constructs was created that uses a PATIENT_OBSERVATION_GROUP consisting of an Observation (OBX) segment, a Participation (PRT) segment and a Comment (NTE) segment inserted in the respective message structures. It is published here: file:///D:\Eigene%20Dateien\2022\HL7\Standards\v2.9.1%20docs\www.hl7.org\permalink\%3fSOGIGuidance[www.hl7.org/permalink/?SOGIGuidance].

{empty}i. This profile is using a different approach from the person specific constructs this document proposes. We are seeking feedback from the community around which solution is more acceptable / implementable / appropriate. Please also comment on the details of the SOGI profile component solution, if that is your preferred approach in how that would need to be modified to accommodate all Gender Harmony concept attributes, as described in the Cross-paradigm Implementation Guide under ballot at http://www.hl7.org/fhir/uv/gender-harmony/2022Sep[http://www.hl7.org/permalink/?GenderHarmonyIGBallot.]

{empty}ii. In order to ensure we stay in sync with vocabulary used to represent the Gender Harmony attributes of a person, please provide feedback on the definitions and associated terminology in the http://www.hl7.org/permalink/?GenderHarmonyIGBallot ballot.

{empty}iii. For this ballot we decided to NOT associate Gender Harmony constructs with the PRT segment, as we feel that these attributes probably do not affect the role / participation of the person in the message event. Please indicate if you disagree with this assumption.

Existing integrations (either with or without clearly documented implementation profiles) are not automatically impacted by updates to the underlying base standard. That is, new concepts or approaches documented in later standards, are not expected to automatically be adopted by existing integrations. Trading partners always have the option to adopt new standards as needed by their use case requirements. This ideal has always been implicit in the v2 standard but has now been explicitly described.

The HL7 balloting effort continues to yield standards that are open to *all* who develop healthcare data processing systems. The experience gained as this and other HL7 Standards have been put into production is reflected in this latest revision of the Version 2 Standards.

HL7 is operating under formal bylaws and balloting procedures. These procedures are modeled on the balloting procedures of other relevant healthcare industry computer messaging standards organizations (e.g., ASTM) and are designed to conform to the requirements of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). ). In June 1994, HL7 became an ANSI Accredited Standards Developing Organization (SDO). HL7 is a founder of the ANSI SDO Charter Organization (SCO) and chaired it in 2011-2012. The other members of the SCO include: The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP), X12N (ASC X12 Insurance Committee), ADA (The American Dental Association), GS1 (International Standards for Bar Codes and Supply Chain), ISO TC 215 (International Medical Informatics), IHE, Regenstreif Institute’s Logical Observation Identifiers, Names and Codes (LOINC), National Library of Medicine for US Systemized Nomenclature for Medicine (SNOMED). And “Standards Related Groups" including IHE (Integrating the Health Enterprise), HIMSS (Health Information Management Systems Society), and WEDI (Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange).

ANSI approval dates HL7’s Version 2 standards are noted below:

 Version 2.2 - February of 1996.

 Version 2.3 - May of 1997.

 Version 2.3.1 - April of 1999.

 Version 2.4 - October 2000.

 Version 2.5 - July of 2003.

 Version 2.5.1 - Feburary of 2007

 Version 2.6 – October 2007

 Version 2.7 – February 2011

 Version 2.8 – February 2014

 Version 2.8.1 – April 2014

 Version 2.8.2 – July 2015

 Version 2.9 – December 2019

As an organization, HL7 has experienced significant growth over the last several years. Currently, HL7’s membership consists of approximately 2200 members in all membership categories and regularly attracts 450-500 members and non‑members to each of its three yearly meetings.
