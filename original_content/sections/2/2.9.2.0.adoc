==== Segment fragmentation/continuation using the ADD segment
[v291_section="2.9.2.0"]

Beginning with version 2.4, the ADD segment can be used [.underline]#within# a message to break a long segment into shorter segments within a single HL7 message.

[NOTE]
Unless some explicit agreement exists between systems, a receiving application SHOULD NOT infer semantic meaning from the placement of the ADD segment.

To break a large segment,

{empty}a) the segment being continued (call it ANY for this example) is ended at an arbitrary character position and terminated with the standard segment terminator (carriage return).

{empty}b) the following segment is the ADD segment. All characters after the ADD and field separator ("|") are logically part of the preceding segment. All succeeding consecutive ADD segments contribute characters to the ANY segment until a non ADD segment is found.

{empty}c) an ADD segment with no field separator takes on special meaning. See Section link:#segment-fragmentation-across-messages[_2.10.2.3_], "link:#segment-fragmentation-across-messages[_Segment fragmentation across messages_]".

For example, segment "C" can be fragmented within an HL7 message as follows:

A|1

B|2

C|34

[er7]
ADD|5|678|

ADD|90

D|1

This is logically the same as

A|1

B|2

C|345|678|90

D|1
