=== Continuation messages and segments
[v291_section="2.9.2"]

Sometimes, implementation limitations require that large messages or segments be broken into manageable chunks. We use the term "fragmentation" to describe how a logical message is broken into one or more separate HL7 messages. HL7 consciously identifies two situations where this MAY happen.

First, a single segment mightbe too large. HL7 uses the "ADD" segment to handle breaking a single segment into several smaller segments.

Second, a single HL7 message might be too large. HL7 uses the DSC segment and the continuation protocol to handle message fragmentation.

[NOTE]
HL7 does not define what "too large" means. Acceptable values are subject to site negotiations.

See chapter 5 for a discussion of the continuation pointer segment and the continuation pointer field, and their use in the continuation of responses to queries and in the continuation of unsolicited update messages.
