=== Early adoption of HL7 changes
[v291_section="2.7.5"]

Early adoption of HL7 changes that have been approved by the technical committee for the next membership ballot is a common practice and is not prohibited, but carries risk. Such changes MAY be rejected or modified in the balloting process. One example is that the change might pass but MAY be positioned differently in the segment or data type.
