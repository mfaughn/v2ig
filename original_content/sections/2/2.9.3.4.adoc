==== Batch message as a query response
[v291_section="2.9.3.4"]

[NOTE]
The QRD and QRF segments were retained for backward compatibility only as of v 2.4. The reader is referred to chapter 5, section 5.4, for the current query/response message structure.

The HL7 query also can be used to query for a batch in the following manner:

{empty}a) use the B in ResponseModality field of the RCP segment. The query will be acknowledged with a general acknowledgment as in the Deferred Access example above (see chapter 5)

.{empty}b) in addition, insert into the batch file the QRD and QRF segments as follows:
[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",]
|===
|[FHS] |(file header segment)
|\{ [BHS] |(batch header segment)
|[QPD] |(the QRD and QRF define the
|[RCP] |query that this batch is a response to)
|\{ MSH |(one or more HL7 messages)
|.... |
|.... |
|.... |
|} |
|[BTS] |(batch trailer segment)
|} |
|[FTS] |(file trailer segment)
|===

{empty}c) the acknowledgment of a batch is described in this chapter (see Section _2.9.3.3_, "_Acknowledging batches_").
