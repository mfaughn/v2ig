==== Caveats for locally extending segments
[v291_section="2.10.4.1"]

Locally extending an HL7 segment with locally defined fields will likely cause conformance problems with the next release of the HL7 standard. There are, however, certain circumstances where HL7 has, itself, directed the membership to add Z fields as an interim measure between versions to accommodate regulatory agency requirements. These are fields that HL7 has reserved for official introduction in the next release.

If the local site intends to add a proposed field early, there is a risk that it might collide with another field when HL7 officially approves or rejects the proposed additions. Some sites have employed the practice of assigning a high sequence number locally, i.e., leaving a gap between the last official HL7 field and the proposed new field. The user–defined fields SHOULD be deleted or deprecated when HL7 officially approves or rejects the proposed additions so that the fields do not collide. It must be understood that the local implementation will have to adjust if a collision occurs and they want to conform.
