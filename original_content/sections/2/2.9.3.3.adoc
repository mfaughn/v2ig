==== Acknowledging batches
[v291_section="2.9.3.3"]

In general, the utility of sending batches of data is that the data is accepted all at once, with errors processed on an exception basis. However, it is a permissible application of HL7 to acknowledge all messages. Several options for acknowledgment are given and will be chosen on an application basis. In these cases, the sequence numbering protocol can be useful to the applications processing the batch.

The options are:

{empty}a) all messages are acknowledged in the response batch.

{empty}b) the receiving system prints some form of batch control report, which is then dealt with manually by personnel at the sending system. No acknowledgments are performed by the protocol software.

{empty}c) an automated acknowledgment batch is created containing acknowledgment messages only for those messages containing errors. In this mode an empty acknowledgment batch MAY be created (i.e., an HL7 batch file without any HL7 acknowledgment messages).

In each case where there is a response batch, its format is a batch of individual messages. Each individual message is in the format defined for an online response in the chapters. Consider, for example, a batch that might be constructed to respond to a batch of Detailed Financial Transactions (Chapter 6). The messages in the response batch would consist entirely of ACK messages, since ACK is the response shown in Chapter 6.

When batches are retransmitted after the correction of errors, link:#_BHS-12___Reference Batch Control ID[BHS-12 Reference Batch Control ID] SHOULD contain the batch control ID of the original batch.
