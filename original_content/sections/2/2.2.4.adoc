=== Acknowledgments: enhanced mode
[v291_section="2.2.4"]

The HL7 acknowledgment paradigm has been extended to distinguish both accept and application acknowledgments, as well the conditions under which each is required. With a positive accept acknowledgment, the receiving system commits the message to safe storage in a manner that releases the sending system from the need to resend the message. After the message has been processed by the receiving system, an application acknowledgment MAY be used to return the resultant status to the sending system.
