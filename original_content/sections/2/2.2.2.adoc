=== Trigger events
[v291_section="2.2.2"]

The Standard is written from the assumption that an event in the real world of healthcare creates the need for data to flow among systems. The real-world event is called the *trigger event*. For example, the trigger event *a patient is admitted* MAY cause the need for data about that patient to be sent to a number of other systems. The trigger event, *an observation (e.g., a CBC result) for a patient is* *available,* MAY cause the need for that observation to be sent to a number of other systems. When the transfer of information is initiated by the application system that deals with the triggering event, the exchange is termed an *unsolicited update*.

[NOTE]
No assumption is made about the design or architecture of the application/ system creating the unsolicited update. The scope of HL7 is restricted to the specification of messages between application/ systems and the events triggering them.

HL7 allows the use of trigger events at several different levels of data granularity and inter-relationships. For example, most Patient Administration (ADT) trigger events concern single objects (such as an admit event, which creates a message that contains data about a single person and/or account). Other ADT trigger events are concerned with relationships between more than one object (e.g., the merge events, which specify patient or account merges). Some ADT trigger events pertain to a collection of objects that MAY have no significant inter-relationships (e.g., a record-oriented location-based query, whose response contains data about a collection of inpatients who are related only temporarily, by local geography).
