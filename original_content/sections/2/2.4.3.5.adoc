==== Data type
[v291_section="2.4.3.5"]

[datatype-definition]
The basic building block used to construct or restrict the contents of a data field.

In the segment attribute tables this information is provided in the column labeled *DT*. If the data type of the field is variable, the notation "varies" will be displayed.

There are a number of data types defined by HL7. See section _2.14_, "file:///D:\Eigene%20Dateien\V27_CH02A_DataTypes.doc[_Data types_]" and in Chapter 2A.

Each field is assigned a data type that defines the value domain of the field – the possible values that it SHALL take. The data type SHALL have a type taken from the list of data types defined in chapter 2A.

Data types MAY be either primitive or composite. Primitive data types consist of a series of characters as specified by the data type. Composite data types are made up of a series of components that are themselves assigned to a data type, which MAY again be either primitive or composite data types. In the case of composite data types, the components of a component are called sub-components, and they SHALL only be assigned primitive data types.

[NOTE]
that the data types do not specify how systems actually store data within an application. When fields are transmitted, they are sent as character strings as specified by the data type.
