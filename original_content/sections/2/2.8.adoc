== Message Processing Rules
[v291_section="2.8"]

The processing rules described here apply to all exchanges of messages, whether or not the HL7 encoding rules or Lower Layer Protocols are used. They represent the primary message processing mode. The user MAY use either the original processing rules, described in section _2.8.2_, "_Message response using the original processing rules_", or -the enhanced processing rules, described in section _2.8.3_, "_Response using enhanced acknowledgment_" . The original mode and the enhanced mode serve different purposes.

[NOTE]
The MCF – Delayed Acknowledgment message has been removed from the standard. It was deprecated in v 2.2. Accordingly, the narrative notes regarding deferred processing have been removed from this section.

Certain variants exist and are documented elsewhere:

{empty}a) an optional sequence number protocol. Refer to section _2.9.1_, "_Sequence number protocol_".

{empty}b) an optional protocol for continuing a very long message. Refer to section _2.9.2_, "_Continuation messages and segments_".

Because the protocol describes an exchange of messages, it is described in terms of two entities, the initiating and responding systems. Each is both a sender and receiver of messages. The initiating system sends first and then receives, while the responding system receives and then sends.

In overview this exchange proceeds as follows:

|Step |Process |Comment
|Step 1 |Initiator constructs an HL7 message from application data and sends it to the responding system |
|Step 2 |Responder receives message and processes it based on rules |The rules differ based on whether the original acknowledge mode or the enhanced acknowledgment mode is followed
|Step 3 |Responder sends response message |
|Step 4 |Initiator processes response message |
