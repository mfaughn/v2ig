=== Segments and segment groups
[v291_section="2.4.2"]

A *segment* is a logical grouping of data fields. Segments of a message MAY be required or optional. They MAY occur only once in a message or they MAY be allowed to repeat. Each segment is given a name. For example, the ADT message MAY contain the following segments: Message Header (MSH), Event Type (EVN), Patient ID (PID), and Patient Visit (PV1).

Each segment is identified by a unique three-character code known as the Segment ID. Although the actual segments are defined in various chapters, the ID codes assigned to the various segments are listed in Appendix A.

All segment ID codes beginning with the letter *Z* are reserved for locally defined segments. Z Codes SHALL NOT be defined within the HL7 Standard.

Two or more segments MAY be organized as a logical unit called a segment group. A segment group MAY be required or optional and might or might not repeat. As of v 2.5, the first segment in a newly defined segment group will be required to help ensure that unparsable messages will not be inadvertently defined. This required first segment is known as the anchor segment.

A segment group is assigned a name that represents a permanent identifier that SHALLNOT be changed.

A named segment X MAY occur more than once in an abstract message syntax. This differs from repetition described earlier in this section. When this occurs, the following rules SHALL be adhered to:

If, within an abstract message syntax, a named segment X appears in two individual or group locations, and

{empty}a) Either appearance is optional or repeating in an individual location or,

{empty}b) either appearance is optional or repeating in a group location

then, the occurrences of segment X SHALL be separated by at least one required segment of a different name so that no ambiguity can exist as to the individual or group location of any occurrence of segment X in a message instance.

|Example 1 |Example 2 |Example 3
|\{ SEG 1} |[ SEG1 ] |SEG1
|SEG2 |\{ |[ SEG2 ]
|[ SEG1 ] |SEG2 |SEG3
| |[ SEG1 ] |\{ SEG1 }

.Examples of unparsable segment grouping
[width="100%",cols="26%,26%,24%,24%",]
|===
|Example 1 |Example 2 |Example 3 |Example 4
|\{ SEG 1} |\{ SEG1 } |[ SEG1 ] |\{ SEG1 }
|[ SEG1 ] |[ SEG2 ] |\{ |[ SEG2
| |SEG1 |[ SEG2 ] |SEG3 ]
| | |SEG1 |SEG1
| | |SEG3 |
| | |} |

In each of these examples it is not possible to tell which part of the message SEG1 belongs.
