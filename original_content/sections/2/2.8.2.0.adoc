==== Accept and validate the message in responding system
[v291_section="2.8.2.0"]

Upon receipt of the message, when the Original Acknowledgment rules are used, the protocol software in the responding system validates it against at least the following criteria:

[NOTE]
Both MSH-15 - accept acknowledgment type and MSH-16 - application acknowledgment type are not present.

{empty}a) the value in link:#_MSH-9___Message Type  (MSG)   00009[MSH-9 Message Type] is one that is acceptable to the receiver.

{empty}b) the value in link:#_MSH-12___Version ID  (VID)   00012[MSH-12 Version ID] is acceptable to the receiver.

{empty}c) the value in link:#_MSH-11___Processing ID  (PT)   0001[MSH-11 Processing ID] is appropriate for the application process handling the message.

If any of these edits fail, the protocol software rejects the message. That is, it creates an ACK message with *AR* in link:#_MSA-1___Acknowledgment Code  (ID)  [MSA-1 Acknowledgment Code].

[NOTE]
If the Acknowledgment Code is other than AA, the reason(s) for the rejection SHOULD be sent in the ERR segment(s) to notify the sender of the exact problem.*

If successful, the process moves to the next step.
