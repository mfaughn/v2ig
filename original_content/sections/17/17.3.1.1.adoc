==== Inventory Locations
[v291_section="17.3.1.1"]

Inventory locations contain a list of items that are stocked at the location, or that can be ordered from the location (but not stocked on a regular basis). Inventory locations receive updates to the attributes of supply items from the general supply location's item master catalog. Even though the general supply location's item master catalog and the other inventory locations item master both share the majority of the supply item attributes, those attributes can have a different value in each location. For example, the status of a supply item (active, inactive, pending inactive), can be inactive in the general supply location item master catalog (meaning it cannot be ordered), but the same item may be pending inactive at another inventory location that still has the supply item in stock, and will issue the supply item until the stock is depleted, but cannot order to replenish the stock at this location.

The following are the primary attributes of a supply item:

Unique identification code

• The unique identification code for a supply item describes a relation to a supply that can be ordered. This would likely be a catalog number specific to a manufacturer of the supply item.

Supply Item Description

• The name or text description of the supply item provides a human-readable identification of the supply.

Supply Item Type

• This attribute describes a type or class of supply items. This would typically be a supply type such as office supplies, OR supplies, or laboratory supplies.
