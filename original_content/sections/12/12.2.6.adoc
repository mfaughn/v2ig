=== Acknowledgment Choreography
[v291_section="12.2.6"]

As of Version 2.9 Infrastructure and Messaging requires that Acknowledgment Choreography be explicitly specified in MSH-15 and MSH-16. Because of the nature of the Query and Response Messaging pattern, the Response message is always an Application Acknowledgment. To specify this, the value in MSH-16 SHALL always be “AL” for those messages that are Queries, to indicate that there will always be an Application Acknowledgment to the Query Message. See Chapter 2 for more details on this subject.
