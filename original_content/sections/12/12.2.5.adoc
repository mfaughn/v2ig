=== Message Construction Rules
[v291_section="12.2.5"]

The semantic meaning of a message is contained in the message through the use of the trigger events, the implicit hierarchical linkages of the segments, and the segment action codes. Each of these has a scope within the message. The message event as included in the MSH-9 Message Type has a scope which is global to the message. The segment hierarchical linkage has a scope which includes both the segment itself and its relationship to its parent. The segment action code's scope is to the segment itself. It may further define link and unlink actions in the hierarchical structure.
