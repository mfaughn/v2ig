=== Trigger Events
[v291_section="12.2.3"]

The trigger events originate goal, problem and pathway messages. Each trigger event is documented below, along with the appropriate form of the message exchange. These are message-level event triggers, which are augmented by the action code fields contained in the pathway, problem and goal segments described below. Action codes are required fields in patient care message segments (see Chapter 2 for further information regarding implementation issues). Implementors need to apply the appropriate logic as part of their message construction (for example, logic would state that an "add" trigger event should not include segments with a "delete" action code).

In order to accommodate these high-level events, the following patient care events are included in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70003[_HL7 Table 0003 – Event Type_]. The added events are instantiated in MSH-9 Message Type and are used by the pathway, problem, and goal messages. MSH-9 Message Type contains the message type and trigger event for the message.
