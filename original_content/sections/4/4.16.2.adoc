The donation service messages facilitate communications between typical system components in a blood bank donation service facility. Frequently different components of blood banking systems (e.g. registration, questionnaire) are bundled together in one system produced by one vendor. However since there is no standard for that bundling, in any particular implementation any of the named system components can be implemented on another system and therefore communications to that component is necessary. The typical components are illustrated in the graphic below.

Additionally, the graphic also depicts a flow of information through those systems during a donation process.
