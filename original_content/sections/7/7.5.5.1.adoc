==== Culture battery/report representation
[v291_section="7.5.5.1"]

Organisms and other observations/tests are reported using multiple OBX segments. The granularity expected for HL7culture reports is one observation per organism.

All OBX segments which have the same observation ID and sub-ID are part of a single observation.

Each organism in a culture battery is assigned a unique _OBX-4 Observation Sub-ID_ (and is therefore a separate observation). The organism name is given in _OBX-5 Observation Value_ (results). It is recommended, but not required, that the organism name may change over time, but the corresponding observation sub-ID never changes. (The observation ID will be identical for all organisms reported.)
