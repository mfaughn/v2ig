==== Battery:
[v291_section="7.2.3.3"]

A set of one or more observations identified as by a single name and code number, and treated as a shorthand unit for ordering or retrieving results of the constituent observations. In keeping with the mathematical conventions about set, a battery can be a single observation. Vital signs, electrolytes, routine admission tests, and obstetrical ultrasound are all examples. Vital signs (conventionally) consist of diastolic and systolic blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate. Electrolytes usually consist of Na+, K+, Cl‑, and HCO3‑. Routine admission tests might contain CBC, Electrolytes, SMA12, and Urinalysis. (Note that the elements of a battery for our purposes may also be batteries.) Obstetrical ultrasound is a battery made up of traditional component measurements and the impression, all of which would be returned as separate results when returned to the requestor. A test involving waveform recording (such as an EKG) can be represented as a battery comprised of results of many categories, including digital waveform data, labels and annotations to the data, measurements, and the impression

The word battery is used in this specification synonymously with the word profile or panel. The individual observation elements within a battery may be characteristic of a physiologic system (e.g., liver function tests), or many different physiologic systems.
