==== Example message
[v291_section="8.6.3.1"]

The initiating system constructs an MFN^M13 message. In this example, the message does not contain site-defined "Z" segments. The following message is sent to the responding system:

[er7]
MSH|^~\&|HL7REG|UH|HL7LAB|CH|200106290544||MFN^M13^MFN_M13|MSGID004|P|2.9||AL|AL

The responder receives the message and performs necessary validation on the message. In this example, it determines the message just received is acceptable for processing. Since _MSH-15 - Accept Acknowledgment_ of the initiating message indicates an accept acknowledgment is required ('AL'), the following ACK message is constructed by the responder and sent to the initiating system to indicate acknowledgment of the MFN^M13 message:

[er7]
MSH|^~\&|HL7LAB|CH|HL7REG|UH|200106290545||ACK^M13^ACK|MSGID99004|P|2.9
[er7]
MSA|CA|MSGID004

[NOTE]
that _MSA-1 - Acknowledgment Code_ contains 'CA' to indicate the message was received and committed to safe storage. This value could also have been 'CE' or 'CR' to indicate the message was received but not processed successfully. _MSA-2 - Message Control ID_ contains the value from _MSH-10 - Message Control ID_ in the initiating MFN^M13 message (MSGID004) to link the acknowledgment response to the initiating message.

The initiating system indicated in this example via _MSH-16 - Application Acknowledgment Type_ that it requires an application level acknowledgment ('AL'). The responder, at some point following the sending of the above ACK message to the initiating system, will process the MFN^M13 message. Once message processing is complete, the application acknowledgment is sent from the responder to the initiating system to indicate the message was processed. The responder constructs an MFK^M13 acknowledgment message, and sends it to the initiating system:

[er7]
MSH|^~\&|HL7LAB|CH|HL7REG|UH|200106290550||MFK^M13^MFK_M13|MSGID99501|P|2.9||AL|

[NOTE]
that _MSA-1 - Acknowledgment Code_ contains 'AA' to indicate the message was received and processed successfully. This value could also have been 'AE' or 'AR' to indicate the message was received but not processed successfully. This value applies to all MFA segments which follow. _MSA-2 - Message Control ID_ contains the value from _MSH-10 - Message Control ID_ in the initiating MFN^M13 message (MSGID004) to link the application acknowledgment response to the initiating message.

The initiating system receives the application acknowledgment message from the responder, and forms an ACK message to acknowledge it. The following message is sent to the responder system:

[er7]
MSH|^~\&|HL7REG|UH|HL7LAB|CH|200106290551||ACK^M13^ACK|MSGID445|P|2.9
[er7]
MSA|CA|MSGID99501

[NOTE]
that _MSA-2 - Message Control ID_ contains the value from _MSH-10 - Message Control ID_ in the MFK^M13 message just received (MSGID99501), and NOT from the initiating MFN^M13 message.
