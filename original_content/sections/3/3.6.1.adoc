=== Swapping a patient
[v291_section="3.6.1"]

Some systems may handle this as a single function. Others may require a multiple process in which:

{empty}a) patient A is assigned a temporary location

{empty}b) patient B is assigned patient A's location

{empty}c) patient A is assigned patient B's prior location

This three‑step scenario requires three separate transfer messages instead of a single swap message. If all beds in a hospital are occupied, it may be necessary to use a dummy location.
