===== Hierarchy of Identifiers
[v291_section="3.6.2.1.1"]

This section was written from the perspective of one controlling MPI and does not adequately cover the implementation of peer MPIs or multiple enterprise identifiers. To avoid future problems implementors should carefully examine the inferences of multiple identifiers.

Enterprise level MPI systems may collaborate forming either peer-to-peer or hierarchical relationships. When this occurs, multiple enterprise level identifiers may be required in the context of a single HL7 message. An example of a peer-to-peer MPI relationship might be represented by a data sharing application between the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the US Department of Defense, where each have their own MPI. An example of a hierarchical MPI relationship might be required by the need for local, city, and state organizations to collaborate, where each have an MPI.

These events assume a hierarchy of identifiers exists between person, patient, account, and visit. The hierarchy is as follows:

Level 3 - Patient (identified by _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_)

Level 2 - Account (identified by _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_)

Level 1 - Visit (identified by _PV1-19 - Visit Number_)

The visit-level identifier _PV1-19 - Visit Number_ is the lowest level identifier and is considered subordinate to the account-level identifier _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_.

This means that visit identifiers are defined within the context of an account identifier, and implies that visit identifiers are unique within account identifiers. Similarly, account identifiers are subordinate to, and unique within, patient identifiers; patient identifiers are subordinate to, and unique within, person identifiers.

Conversely, the person-level identifier is the highest-level identifier and is considered superior to the patient-level identifiers, which are superior to the account-level identifier, which is superior to any visit-level identifiers.

[NOTE]
that these events will also apply to environments in which one or more of these levels do not occur. For example, some environments may not have a person (or MPI) level, or they may not have a visit level, or they may have a visit level without an account level. The hierarchy concept is depicted graphically below. For example, Adam Everyman might be assigned an MPI number at the Good Health Hospital network (depicted by the circle). He may have different medical records at two hospitals within the network (depicted by the squares). Associated with each of these medical records are two accounts (depicted by the triangles). Note that the environment illustrated does not support the "visit" level, although in other implementations it might.
