==== MPI QUERY for person lookup and identification
[v291_section="3.6.4.3"]

Several QBP/RSP queries have been developed to aid in the integration of systems with an MPI. They consist of several Qxx/Kxx trigger/response pairs and one Q24/K24 trigger/response pair. The following table lists their functions:

.MPI QBP/RSP Queries
[width="100%",cols="15%,28%,57%",]
|===
|Query |Name |MPI Use
|Q21/K21 |Get Person Demographics |Given a person identifier, return the PID and optionally the PD1 segments for the matching person.
|Q22/K22 |Find Candidates |Given some demographics, optionally a match threshold and algorithm, find and return a list of matching persons.
|Q23/K23 |Get Corresponding Identifiers |Given a person's identifier and a list of identifier domains, return the person's identifiers in those domains.
|Q24/K24 |Allocate Identifiers |Given a list of identifier domains, return new identifiers for those domains. Should not link to a person, just reserve and return identifiers.

The following sections show several scenarios involving looking up a person on a "client" system, and how it can be integrated to an MPI. The basic flow is for a user to enter person information on the client system, and the client system using services of the MPI to match the user's input to a person that exists somewhere on the two systems.

The scenarios are differentiated on two variables:

*ID Creator -* Which system assigns new person identifiers for the client system. This can either be the MPI or the client system.

*Person Existence -* On which system the person record currently exists - the client system, the MPI, or both.
