==== Client system assigns identifier, person exists on neither system
[v291_section="3.6.4.6"]

In this scenario, a client system (e.g., a registration system) will query an MPI for a person, and the person does not exist on either system. The MPI returns a list of possible matching candidates, or possibly an empty list. The user does _not_ choose one, and a new person record is created.
