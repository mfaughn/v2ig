|A45 - Move visit information - visit number |
|Use Case - Eve Everywoman (patient identifier MR1) is a recurring outpatient at the Physical Therapy and Speech Therapy clinics at hospital XYZ. She is assigned a different account for each clinic; her account number for Physical Therapy is ACCT1 and her account number for Speech Therapy is X1. However, on two different occasions, the Speech Therapy registrar accidentally assigned her visits (96102 and 96104) to the Physical Therapy account. The problem is later discovered and the corresponding visits are moved to the correct account. |
|Target: _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ and _PV1-19 - Visit Number_. |
|Source: _MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_ and _MRG-5 - Prior Visit Number_. |

In the above transaction/implementation, the application that generated the message assigns unique visit numbers.

Implementation Considerations: In this scenario the repeating MRG/PV1 construct is used to indicate which visits are moved, as illustrated in the Example Transaction__. MRG-5 - Prior Visit Number__ and _PV1-19 - Visit Number_ are the same values because the visit numbers do not change. Refer to section link:#_Global_merge_and_move message const[_3.6.2.1.9_], "link:#_Global_merge_and_move message const[_Global merge and move message construct versus repeating segment message constructs&#44;_]" for additional information regarding message construct.
